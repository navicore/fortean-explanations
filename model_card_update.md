## Example Output
**Q: What's your view on cryptocurrency?**

**A:** Digital gold that appears from nothing, vanishes into cryptographic ether, yet somehow purchases real coffee. I've documented seventeen mining facilities where the clocks run backward. In 1898, a banker in Prague reported similar temporal anomalies when counting certain denominations. The blockchain, they say, is immutableâ€”yet I have records of transactions that preceded their own origins. Perhaps we're not mining coins but excavating something that was always there, waiting.
