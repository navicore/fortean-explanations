    "text": "I\n\n_To Robert Lynn, M.R.C.S., Applebrook, Devon._\n\n 91B HARLEY STREET, W.,\n _March_ 4, 1910. MY DEAR BOB,\n\nYour letter of this morning, like the cream that it was, rose naturally\nto the surface of the little pile of correspondence that awaited me on\nthe breakfast-table; and if I didn't read it then, and am only answering\nit now, in front of my dressing-room fire, there are more reasons than\none for this. You might even detect a little pathos, perhaps, in the\nchief of these. For I can't help feeling that a younger man--myself, for\nexample, twenty years ago--would have been into it before you could say\nscalpel, snatching his joy as one of your own parr will take a Wickham\non a clear pool before the half-pounder beside him has even decided to\ninspect it. And if I have not done this, if I have learned the better\nway, the art of lingering, the value of the \"bouquet,\" well, there's a\nrather forlorn piece of scalp in the opposite looking-glass to tell me\nthe reason why. So you see that I didn't rush headlong at your letter, tearing it open\nwith a feverish, if mature, forefinger. I even ignored the twinkle in my\nwife's eye, and the more impertinent expression that Miss Molly was\npermitting to rest upon her usually calm features. \"Another lump, my pet,\" was all I said, and stirred my coffee with that\ninscrutable calm so justly associated with Destiny, Wisdom, and the\nConsulting Physician. \"He's pretending not to be excited,\" explained Miss Molly to a college\nfriend across the table; and Claire, all chestnut mop and\nblack-stockinged legs (and convalescent, by the way, from the mumps),\ngurgled suddenly over her Henty when she ought by rights to have been\ncompletely breathless. Through the open window a pleasant breeze stirred lazily across the\ntable, decked with its stolen sweets from our own and our neighbours'\nhyacinths. And in a welcome sunshine the windows of Sir Jeremy's\nconsulting-room beamed as merrily as their owner's eyes. \"And not even one spark of enthusiasm,\" proceeded Molly. \"Oh, who would\nhave a mere physician for a parent?\"\n\n\"For the elderly,\" I told her, \"excitement is to be deprecated. Now if I\nwere twenty-four, perhaps----\"\n\n\"Twenty-three,\" put in Molly, adding, with very great distinctness,\n\"to-morrow.\"\n\n\"And that reminds me,\" murmured Claire from her sofa under the window. So I opened the other envelopes first, those that contained the bills,\nthe appointments, the invitations, and the unpleasant letters, just as a\nwise man should, who is at his best, and realizes it, tubbed and shaved\nand over his breakfast bacon. And since Molly and her friend appeared to\nhave interrupted themselves in the midst of some earnest political\ndiscussion, I begged them to resume this. For in making the\nbreakfast-table their judgment-bar they were setting an example, as I\nreminded them, that the world would do well to follow. Breakfast-table\nverdicts, breakfast-table sermons, breakfast-table laws, for true and\nkindly sanity they might be safely backed, I observed, against any\nproduct of the midnight oil that has emerged from the brain of\nman--including even woman as produced by Newnham; or so, at any rate,\nthought a middle-aged physician whose opinions were dear to me. Only,\nof course, it would have to be a well-furnished table; and the\nmarmalade, if possible, should have been made at home. \"You had better just _glance_ at it though, hadn't you?\" asked\nEsther--dear, wise Esther--from her throne behind the urn; after which\nthere was quite obviously nothing else to be done. Applebrook--glorious\npostmark--it had already begun to weave its magic for me as I slipped a\nknife into the comfortable envelope, and ran a well-mastered eye over\nits contents. \"Nothing of importance,\" I announced; \"only fish.\"\n\n\"_Only_ fish,\" scoffed Molly, well into her third muffin. And yet, though I have not actually read it till just now--my sacred ten\nminutes before the dinner-gong summons me downstairs--your letter has\nreally followed me all day, even as Applebrook itself will follow a\nreturning angler down the evening moor, and ripple through his\nafter-supper dreams. It has blessed me, and made a dull day bright (for\nthe sun began to sulk again at noon), and the more so because my wisdom\nkept it at a distance until just now. Applebrook--as I emerged from the\nDistrict Railway into that faint but inexorable smell of burnt coffee\nand human unwashedness which broods over Whitechapel Road, the extra\nbulge in my breast-pocket reminded me suddenly of wind-blown gorse and\nall the hard-bitten, sunburnt heath that stands for Dartmoor. My step\nquickened. I entered the hospital gates with a jauntier tread, and could\nhave sworn that a silver trout shot spectrally round the corner in front\nof me. A poor presage for my lucidity in the afternoon march round the\nwards, I can hear you murmur. But you are wrong there. For, on the\ncontrary, the points of my discourse made their bows to my memory with\nunwonted briskness; and I contrived, I think, to keep the\nnotebook-pencils pretty busy. Yet the afternoon did contain one of those disquieting surprises that\nused at one time to seem so catastrophic, and now appear only too\nwonderfully uncommon. For some weeks past I have had a poor fellow in\none of my beds, a cheerful soul, for all he knew himself to be treading\na downhill road. His condition, rather an obscure one, and in any event\nincurable, might have represented one of two causes. Week by week, to a\nrespectful and intelligent body of students, I have demonstrated the\nsigns and symptoms of this patient, and proved to them how, on the\nwhole, they must be taken to indicate B--shall we say?--as the root of\nthe mischief. And now to-day, before an expectant gathering, the\nuncompromising knife of the pathologist in the post-mortem room has\nrevealed the precisely opposite.",

And now to-day, before an expectant gathering, the\nuncompromising knife of the pathologist in the post-mortem room has\nrevealed the precisely opposite. It was A all the time, and there was\nnothing for it but to accept defeat, and retire strategically in as good\nan order as might be. There was, at any rate, the consolation that the\nmistake could not have affected the unhappy issue of the malady. It was\nmerely a sort of academic pride that was to suffer; and I suppose it is\nonly an acquired familiarity with death that could have made so small a\npersonal disaster even imaginable--for I don't think it ever really\nbecame actual--under its great shadow. So I made my retreat--in fair\norder, I believe, with baggage intact and a minimum of casualties. Nevertheless I caught young Martyn, the wing three, you know--what\nwouldn't I have given for his swerve thirty years ago!--smiling\nsignificantly across at your son, who was very tactfully endeavouring to\nappear oblivious. And it was Applebrook that fortified my powers of\nforgiveness--Applebrook rippling peacefully over its immemorial granite. And so there's plenty of water, is there, and the colour has been just\nright? And you have already been into a pounder, and landed him too. That's good, for though we miss a lot of pounders in Applebrook--\"a\npound, sir, if it weighed an ounce, and took half the cast away with\nit\"--we seldom land one. And am I game to come down on May 1st as usual? A day-dream, or dusk-dream, has been interrupted here--I might have\nprophesied it--by one of those earnest, cadaverous persons whose pride\nit is that they have never taken--never felt the need of it, they\nusually add--a holiday in their lives. \"Not for thirty-five years, sir,\" said this latest specimen to me just\nnow, rubbing his hands with counting-house pride. \"God help you,\" I replied, which took him aback a little, and was not, I\nadmit, a tactful welcome to a prospective two guineas. But then, you\nsee, he had fetched me back from a dusk-dream. \"Does that mean _you_ can't?\" he inquired a little acidly. And really I\nshould not have been quite so abrupt with him, for his confession gave\nme the right cue to his treatment. A holiday, in fact, was all that he\nneeded, though I doubted his ability to use one. So I assumed my\nheaviest manner, as one must when it is to be unaccompanied by an\nexpensive prescription. \"If you don't take one,\" I proceeded to tell him, \"though you will\nprobably survive with the aid of iron, arsenic, and an occasional\nSeidlitz powder, you will become eventually like those sorrowful civil\nservants that may be met at almost any time in Somerset House or the\nGeneral Post Office. They have been pensioned for months, but there they\nare, unable to inter themselves decently among the mashies and geraniums\nof Wimbledon and Weybridge, haunting their former desks, poor forlorn\ncreatures, whose one bond of life has been severed--a torture to\nthemselves and their successors.\"\n\nWhile I was taking breath after this rather impressive harangue, he\nstared at me gloomily. \"It has always,\" he said, \"been my one great desire to die in harness.\"\n\nAfter congratulating him on the possession of so modest, if somewhat\ncheerless, an ambition, I asked him why he had come to see me. A\nphysician, to a man with such a goal, seemed, on the face of it,\nsomething of a superfluity. But I learned that there was a wife at home,\npoor soul. And it was her doctor, he said, who had recommended this\nvisit. \"And I may tell you,\" he added, \"that your opinion coincides with\ntheirs.\" He handed me his two guineas. \"Where shall I go?\" he asked. By now of course I could see that my advice was going to be useless; but\nthere was no better alternative. \"Have you any hobbies?\" I inquired. But he shook his head. No; he had\nnever had time for hobbies. And by to-morrow afternoon he will be\nreading his _Financial News_ on Brighton Pier, and wondering when he can\ndecently return. * * * * *\n\nBut the dressing-gong has sounded already, and the embers in my fire are\nreddening into darkness. Outside, the wheels of a myriad motor-cars and\ncarriages pass ceaselessly, and repass; and from beyond and beneath\nthem, through the open window, comes the roar of London. I believe you\nsigh for it sometimes, don't you, down there among your moorland\nsilences? Give me three weeks of it a year, and, as far as I am\nconcerned, you might monopolise the orchestra for the other forty-nine. I don't particularly want my dinner, and I am still less inclined to\ntalk amiably with the two dull, but worthy, guests--may the gods of\nhospitality forgive me--who are to sit at our board to-night. With the\ntired girl-poet, I am praying instead;\n\n God, for the little streams that tumble as they run.",

By the way,\nsomebody ought to write an essay on the Personality of Railway Stations. Liverpool Street, for example, smokes cheap cigarettes, and lives at\nWalthamstow--does its baggage up with string, and takes dribbly children\nto Clacton-on-Sea. And Paddington is a sun-tanned country squire, riding\na good thirteen stone, and with an eye for an apple. His luggage is of a\nwell-ripened leather, and he is a bit lavish with his tips. * * * * *\n\nBut, alas, my door merely opens to admit the timid nose of a new maid\nwho announces the arrival of the visitors.

Won't I! And till then I can merely remain London-bound. Your envious old friend,\n P. H.",

    "text": "II\n\n_To Horace Harding, Trinity College, Cambridge._\n\n 91B HARLEY STREET, W.,\n _March_ 11, 1910. MY DEAR HORACE,\n\nCasting a remorseful eye at the date upon your letter, I perceive that\nit is already almost a week since I resolved to sit down, and answer it\nimmediately; and the postscript that follows \"your aff. son H.\" gazes at\nme with a rebuking stare, as if to remind me how very far I have been\nfrom bucking up, as you so tactfully suggested, and flooring the problem\nwith which you have presented me. And yet you mustn't suppose that I\nhave been altogether too careless or too busy to deal with it as you\nwished. On the other hand, I have been dodging it round the ring of\neveryday happenings ever since I first beheld it eyeing me beneath the\nTrinity crest. For the fact of the matter is, my dear Horace, that your\nrevered Daddy has all along been more than doubtful about his ability to\nstretch the fellow on the carpet. And now, at the end of a week's\nsomewhat cowardly--footwork, shall we call it?--he has decided to crawl\nunder the ropes, and make room for a lustier substitute. Shall you become a doctor? Well, I'm afraid, after all, that you must\ntackle the question for yourself. As an American patient, with a\ndoubtful liver, observed to me this morning, the problem is right up\nagainst you; and nobody else can defeat it in your stead. The thought of\nthis has cheered me so amazingly that from now onwards you may safely\nimagine, I think, an almost contented physician, sitting plumply in a\nfront stall, smiling at the fight over contemplative finger-tips, and\nmerely tendering, between the rounds, some well-worn pieces of ring-side\nadvice. And so the peaks are challenging you, eh? The wig, the gaiters, the gold\n_pince-nez_, and the bedside manner, they have risen up to bid you\nchoose your future path. For twenty-two years, you tell me, you haven't\ngreatly disturbed yourself about these things. You have accepted\nparental orders: you have taken, in consequence, a respectable, if not\ndistinguished, degree in classics; you have mastered enough science to\nrob your \"first medical\" of most of its fears; and you have obtained, by\nthe way, a Rugger \"blue,\" of which you are, no doubt, a great deal more\nproud. And now that all this has been accomplished you turn to your\nformer guide, and say to him, \"Whither away?\" And like Gilbert's poor\nwit, I feel inclined to retort very truthfully that I do indeed wither\naway. Behold, I have vanished. The mountain range is before you. Choose\nyour summit. * * * * *\n\nAs if to point a moral, I have been here interrupted by a pitiful voice\nover the telephone. Indeed for a week past, I have been its victim at\nvarying intervals. For Mrs. Cholmondeley, let us call her, cannot make\nup her mind between the rival hygienic attractions of Cannes and\nTorquay. As a matter of fact Camberwell or Camden Town would be equally,\nprobably more, effectual. Organically she is perfectly sound. For the\nrest she is merely over-fed and under-occupied. She has deleted very\nnearly every healthful activity from her list of physical employments. And now those of her will are to be similarly abandoned; delegated to\npaid assistants like myself. Cannes or Torquay? Well, I have refused the responsibility of deciding. In league with her long-suffering family physician, I am endeavouring\nto force her faculties to make this little effort by themselves. For I\ndoubt if the sorrowful gates of illness behold anything more entirely\npitiable than the spectacle of a will on crutches. Well then, having, as you see, completely foisted the ultimate issue\nupon your own shoulders, it seems to me that there are three main\nstandpoints from which you must regard our profession before finally\ndeciding to embark upon it. To take the least important of these first,\nyou must bear in mind, I think, that while you should undoubtedly be\nable to pay your way, and to make an honest living, yet the financial\nrewards that medicine has to offer are scarcely worth considering. Given\nan equal amount of capital, both in brain-power and pounds sterling,\nyour hours of work, your expenditure of energy, your capacity for\ndiagnosis and research, your readiness at the reading of human nature,\nwould bring you a far greater return of this world's goods in almost any\nother occupation that you care to name--incomparably so in commerce. At\nthe same time I don't think that this point of view will detain you very\nlong; because, however little fathers may really know of their own sons\n(and the sum of parental ignorance under this heading must be something\nrather stupendous), I am quite sure that the financial laurel, _per se_,\nhas no overwhelming attraction for you. Having deigned then to consider the problem from this lowest and most\nsordid standpoint, you should shift your ground, I think, and reflect\nupon it from the midmost of my three Pisgahs, the scientific one. If I\nhaven't led you to this first, it is because you have probably scrambled\nup it already, and paid no attention at all to the one that I have just\nrecommended to you. And in a sense your instinct will perhaps have taken\nyou by a straighter route to the heart of this matter than that which\nyour more prudent parent has indicated. Because ultimately it is from\nthis point that you will have to make your final decision. You must ask\nyourself, with all the earnestness of a novice at his altar-vigil, \"Am I\nprepared to _know_?\"\n\nFor the long day of the charlatan and the quack is drawing at last to\nits close, and their sun is even now setting in a blaze of\npatent-medicine advertisements.",

Modern Europe has almost ceased to be\npossible for the would-be Paracelsus; even America will not contain him,\nI think, for very much longer. And through a dissolving mist of white\nspats and atrocious Latin the eyes of humanity are turning slowly, but\nvery surely, towards the man who _knows_. Are you prepared to become\nsuch a man? I fancy that I can see your forehead wrinkling a little here; so let me\nexplain myself in a parable. There is an old story, familiar in the\nhospitals, of a bygone practitioner whose simple habit it was to tie a\npiece of string about the waist of his patient. He would then ask the\nsufferer to locate the pain. If this were above the string he\nadministered an emetic, if below a purgative; while if the pain and the\nstring coincided, the unhappy victim would receive both. Now it is\nmelancholy to reflect that this gentleman has never been without\ndisciples. And yet how difficult at times may it become to avoid such a\nfate. Are you prepared to avoid it? Let me put the question in yet another shape. Some day a patient will\ncome to you--you may be quite certain that he will--at the end of a long\nround or an exhausting afternoon at hospital; will complain to you of\nhis lamentable depression of spirits, his entire loss of appetite, his\nslight but continual headache; and will show you, in confirmation of\nthese symptoms, nothing graver, let us say, than a dull eye and a\nyellowish tongue. You will be tired; you will see at a glance that his\nsubjective troubles are altogether disproportionate to the objective\ngravity of his complaint, and perhaps justifiably you will send him away\nhappy, or at any rate contented, in the belief that he is a bit\n\"liverish.\" But are you going to allow \"liverish\" to satisfy yourself? \"Of course not,\" you reply; and yet, believe me, my son, it will be a\nvery real temptation. Why bother, at a long day's end, to worry your\ntired faculties into presenting to your mind as exact a mental picture\nof the man's actual condition as they can draw? Nevertheless, unless you\ndo this, you will be treating him with less respect than your old\nbicycle in the coach-house; as though, if it should creak or wheeze or\nbegin to run less smoothly, you would merely tell yourself that it was\n\"wheelish,\" and drop oil at random into its most convenient aperture. Do\nyou begin to see what I am driving at? And then you will probably turn upon me and say, \"But to cultivate this\nhabit of forming proper mental pictures, I shall have to be at least a\nchemist, a physicist, a pathologist, a bacteriologist, to say nothing of\na philosopher; and how can a single human being, however industrious,\ncontain as many persons as these?\" And of course he cannot. Upon no\nmore than one branch of the tree of Healing will it be given to you to\nclimb out a little farther than your fellows; but, at any rate, you can\nkeep your eye upon the others. It is in this way alone that you can\nbecome a scientific physician in the best and broadest sense. And you\ncan take my word for it that it will never be worth your while to become\nany other sort of a sawbones--an exacting prospect? I agree with you. And many an hour will come to you with the easy question, \"Why lavish\nall this time and trouble in gathering up some very trifling grain of\nextra knowledge--knowledge that, in all probability, will never become\nof the least importance in your hands?\"\n\nAnd then, perhaps, a moment will flash into your life when this very\ngrain shall shape a million destinies. Are you prepared to live for that\nmoment? I am almost tempted to finish my letter at this question mark; and the\nmore so because the great public, or such of it as has been led away by\na certain school of literary sentimentalists, has plastered my final\nmound of observation--shall we call it the human one?--with such a\nviscid layer of adulation that it has become a little hard for a\nself-respecting physician to take his stand there even for two and a\nhalf moments. Has ever, I wonder, a doctor figured in fiction or drama\nwho, being neither a clown nor a fool, was not described as noble? Have\nwe not tracked him on his rounds through unconscionable horrors, and\nwept big tears at his preposterous death-bed? No wonder such a fellow\nfinds it hard to get his bills paid. To offer him mere money would seem\nlittle less than sacrilege. And yet, I think, you will agree with me that here is an aspect of\nmedicine worth consideration. To the seeing eye and the tender hand\nthere is no easier door into the warm heart of humanity.",

To the seeing eye and the tender hand\nthere is no easier door into the warm heart of humanity. There is no\nother profession that will lead you quite so close to reality. And by\nthis I don't mean realism in the modern sense, wherein, as it seems to\nme, the altogether ugly looms so disproportionately large. For after\nthirty years of tolerably wide opportunity I have still failed to find\nthe altogether ugly. And though of course you will meet ugliness in\nplenty--a cancer that will find you shocked and, alas, largely\nimpotent--yet, if you look long enough, and carefully enough, how often\nwill you discover it to be but the shadow of some clearly shining\nspiritual beauty. No, you need not fear, I think, to tread behind the\nveil. And now let me round off my epistle with a brief reminiscence. In my\nearly twenties, just after I had qualified, I travelled down to a small\nfishing-village in Cornwall to act there as locum tenens for a\npractitioner who had finally broken down in health. The practice, mostly\namong a poor population, was a scattered one, and I was kept fairly\nbusy; so busy, in fact, that beyond a hazy impression of buffeting\nacross estuaries in big-bottomed ferryboats, and driving, upon a wild\nnight or two, along as rough a coast-line as one could desire to see, I\nremember very little of that month's experiences. One remains with me. And you must imagine a rather tumble-down,\ntwopenny-halfpenny cottage, half-way down a cobbled street, with its\nfront door opening directly into a tiny living-room. A youthful-looking\nHippocrates is backing out of it rather more awkwardly than usual. And\nin front of him, still holding one of his hands, is a willowy, comely\nCornish lass, mother of three, with the most disturbingly moist-looking\neyes. In the background there would be, I think, a very old and rugged\nwoman, crooning over her youngest grandchild, just recovered, happily,\nand rather miraculously, from a very tough attack of pneumonia. The\nyoung man had been telling them, this simple family, that he was going\naway now, back to London and the big hospital. And hence--dare I write\nit?--hence these tears. \"Ah, doctor,\" says the lassie, \"'tis wisht you've made us. An'\nwhatever'll us do now if the little uns take bad?\"\n\n\"Oh, rot,\" says the blushing physician, jolted for the moment out of a\nrather elaborate bedside manner--\"nonsense, I mean. You'll get along all\nright. There's another man coming. And I didn't do anything, you know,\nreally.\"\n\n\"Didn't do nothen? D'you hear that, mother?\" And the old woman looks up,\nwith her wrinkled cheeks and cavernous, sea-blue eyes. \"D'you think us\ndon't know very well as you've saved the poor lamb's life?\"\n\nAnd so, as Pepys would say, into the wet, bright street, and up the hill\nto the surgery. She was under a misapprehension, of course. Presently,\nif you take up medicine, you will learn that a doctor's part in the\ntreatment of pneumonia consists chiefly of a masterly inactivity.

    "text": "III\n\n_To Miss Josephine Summers, The Cottage, Potham, Beds._\n\n 91B HARLEY STREET, W.,\n _March_ 14, 1910. MY DEAR AUNT JOSEPHINE,\n\nI am very glad to learn that your health on the whole has not been much\nworse since your visit to us last month. And I have no doubt that this\nlast week's sunshine will have already improved it. Claire is now quite\nfit again after a mild attack of mumps, and goes back to Eastbourne in\ntwo days' time. With regard to your rheumatism, there are, as you say, several kinds of\nthis complaint, or at any rate a good many affections that go popularly\nunder the same name. And I think that it is quite likely that the\nwearing of a ring upon your third finger might very probably benefit\nyour own particular variety, though I am much more doubtful about its\nefficacy in the case of your coachman's wife. Yes, there are two I's in\nbacilli, as you point out, but I'm afraid that the article you read in\nthe paper is quite correct in stating that our insides contain a very\nlarge number of these active little animals. Nor is the female sex\nexempt, I'm sorry to say. But it is an idea that one soon gets used to,\nand I doubt if the measures that you suggest will make a very great\ndifference either to their health or your own. But there was once a wise\nold doctor who used to say that between milk and good sound blood there\nwas no difference but the colour. Personally I prefer it sweet. But the\nsour kind is no doubt better than none at all. With best love from Esther and the girls,\n\n Your affect. nephew,\n PETER HARDING.",

    "text": "IV\n\n_To Colonel R. F. Morris, C.B., 7th Division, Meerut, India._\n\n 91B HARLEY STREET, W.,\n _March_ 15, 1910. MY DEAR RUPERT,\n\nIt gave me real joy to see your hand-writing again this morning on the\nbreakfast-table. Only last week I had been thinking that one of your\nrare letters was about due. So you have just had the time of your life,\nhave you, during your last shoot in Kashmir, and find Meerut, as a\nresult, pretty deadly--and oh to be in England now that April's nearly\nthere? A pestilent thing, isn't it, this divine discontent? Only last\nweek I had a letter from old Bob Lynn. You remember Bob. You were his\nfag, I think, for half a term. London, London, London--that was the\nburden of his desire; and he with a trout stream, by turns cavernous and\nromantic and sheerly lyrical, splashing his very doorstep! And now here are you, too, sighing for Pall Mall and the Park, whereas\nI, who have them both, would hold six months at Meerut as a cheap price\nindeed for those seven weeks of Kashmir forests. Is it racial, or\nuniversal, or merely temperamental, I wonder, this passionate yearning\nto be elsewhere--some uncrushable remnant of Romance? I give it up. I am\nsure that it is a nuisance; and equally certain that it is in reality\nthe very salt of life. Coming home sometimes in a tube railway-carriage--the latest invention\nof the modern impersonal Devil--I glance down the long line of returning\nCity faces. There they are, sleek, absorbed, consciously prosperous. And\nI wonder if they are to be read as indications of an absolute content;\nor do they conceal, by some stern effort of will, a restless desire for\nsnow mountains, forests, moors, streams, sunshine, anything in fact that\nis the antithesis of Oxford Circus? It is hard to believe it; and yet I\nam not so sure that it is even unlikely. For as Matthews, the alienist,\nsaid to me the other day, the only _really_ contented people are usually\nto be found in lunatic asylums. So we must give them the benefit of the\ndoubt. But it's news that you want and not surmise. And first of all let me reassure you, and with no shadow of professional\nreserve, about your aunt--I was almost going to write your mother--Lady\nWroxton. For a month or two, it is true, I was really in anxiety about\nher. Sir Hugh's death was a literal dividing in twain of every interest\nof her life, and the very breadth and diversity of these was the\nconsequent measure of her suffering. But, as you know, that fine,\ndeep-founded will of hers could never really fail her. And even in the\ndarkest days of her first grief and almost complete insomnia it was\nthere for us inadequate physicians to work upon--our stay and hers. Since then she has been resting down at Stoke, and has been progressing\nslowly but steadily. I saw her last month for half an hour, and\nRochester, one of the best of G.P.'s, has written to me with increasing\nconfidence in each letter; so that I hope, when you return in the\nautumn, you will find her again the strong, serene woman whom we both\nlove so well. As regards ourselves--well, if the ratio between happiness and history\nthat is supposed to hold good for nations is equally true of families,\nours must be singularly blessed. For, upon my soul, I find it very hard\nto think of any at all. We are all a little older, of course, and both\nEsther and I have made modest additions to our equipment--of grey hairs. For me there is, at any rate, in this the compensation of that\nincreasing maturity of appearance which lends weight to my opinions in\nthe eyes of a good many of my patients. For Esther, I suppose, there is\nnone. But (I speak of course as a husband. And who should know better?)\nthey are not altogether unbecoming. And it is chiefly in the children that the march of time is being most\nvisibly displayed for us. Every month, or so it seems to us, they are\naltering before our eyes. And the adventures, as a consequence, have\nbeen chiefly theirs. Horace, for example, has filled out and solidified\nto an alarming extent during the last year or so, tips the scale at\nthirteen stone, ventures an occasional opinion on wine and the other\nmembers of its trinity, and has succeeded in attaining his Rugger\n\"blue.\" It is his last year at Cambridge though and I'm afraid that the\nmemory of his one and only Varsity match at Queen's is likely to be a\nlittle chequered. For, as you probably know, it was a record defeat; and\nthough both teams were fairly matched as regarded the forwards, Oxford\nwas vastly superior in all other departments of the game, as the\nsporting papers say. But it was a great spectacle for the onlookers. The\nOxford threes, magnificently set in motion by their stand-off half,\nwere quite an ideal picture of clever and unselfish attack. Time and\nagain they swept down the field, alert, speedy, and opportunist, in the\ncleanest sense of the word. The weakness of the opposition flattered\nthem, no doubt. But it was a splendid and invigorating exhibition for\nall that, and one that must have sent the blood tingling enviously down\na good many middle-aged arteries. For there's always something superbly\ntonic about this particular match, emanating even more from the\nsurrounding crowd than from the actual struggle of healthy young\nathletes that it has come to witness. There is no other large crowd\nquite like it, so unanimously well-coloured, clean, and cheerful, so\nlusty of shoulder and clear of eye. The winter air has set a colour in\nthe girls' cheeks, to be heightened presently by the instructed ardour\nwith which they follow the doings of their cousins and brothers, or\ncousins' and brothers' friends.",

The winter air has set a colour in\nthe girls' cheeks, to be heightened presently by the instructed ardour\nwith which they follow the doings of their cousins and brothers, or\ncousins' and brothers' friends. And even the old duffers among us seem\nto don an infectious vitality as we greet our grey-haired friends by\nrope and doorway. The strained eyes and late-night cheeks that are not\nuncommon at such comparable gatherings as those at Lord's and Henley are\nto be sought in vain at this mid-winter festival. And I can think of no\nsounder answer to the modern cries of race-degeneracy than a stroll\nround Queen's at half-time. \"Ah, but that shows you merely the cream,\"\nyou may tell me. But then races, like milks, must be judged, I think, by\nthe cream that they produce. And this particular spectacle at Queen's is\nsufficiently reassuring both as to quality and amount. Well, it was a great game, and I wish you could have been there to see\nit. Molly, with the halo of Newnham still upon her, was as enthusiastic\nas her tradition will allow, while Claire, on a special holiday from her\nschool at Eastbourne, was quite openly broken-hearted for poor Horace's\nsake. However, he got enough hero-worshipping next day to soothe the\nmost wounded of defeated warriors. The more prosaic problem of how to\ntackle his future is troubling him now; and I more than half suspect him\nof designs on Medicine. Molly, on the other hand, is disturbed by no such uncertainty. She is\nalready on the committee of the W.S.P.U., which being interpreted means\nthe Women's Social and Political Union; and concerns herself vigorously\nwith the vexed questions of adult suffrage and the feminine vote. Besides this she is assistant manager of a girls' club in Hoxton, and\ncombines an intense faith in the political future of her sex with an\nardent admiration for Mr. Wells and Mr. Shaw. Religiously, she is, for\nthe moment (to the acute distress of some of our nearer relatives),\ninclining to an up-to-date form of polytheism; but hedges with an\noccasional (rather unobtrusive) attendance at a more orthodox early\nservice. Fortunately she is inveterately addicted to the coldest of cold\nbaths, the roughest of towels, and a plentiful breakfast. Moreover\nanother phase of experience is presenting itself modestly, but with a\nquite unmistakable sturdiness, to her consideration. He is a nice,\nopen-air sort of boy (_entre nous_, Bob Lynn junior. What fogies we are\ngetting, to be sure), untroubled about the constitution of his _ego_,\nand frankly bored by politics, but with a passion for his microscope\nthat must be running, I think, a very neck-and-neck sort of race with\nhis admiration for Miss Molly. Tom, as you know, is still at Rugby; and about him we are all, that is\nEsther and I and Jakes, his house-master, a little anxious. For it seems\nthat during the latter part of his Christmas holidays, which he spent\nwith a friend at Scarborough, he fell very deeply under the influence of\none of those ardent, but dangerous, people possessed of what they\ndescribe as a passion for souls. This particular one, a sort of\nnondescript with private means, was what he called, and what he has\ntried to make Tom and his friend, an \"out and outer.\"\n\nObviously shyly, Tom sent us a programme of this man's meetings--he was\nholding a mission to schoolboys--from which we gathered that his\nparticular spiritual preserves are confined to our larger public\nschools. He was a little careful to emphasise this. Boys from elsewhere\nwere only permitted to hear him by special introduction. He has not\napparently been to a public school himself; but owns, or was once owned\nby, one of the more recent colleges at Cambridge. I hope that I am not\nwriting this too bitterly, for I am trying to be kind to his motives. But the results of his efforts upon Tom have been, up to the present,\nrather devastating. The boy is quite clearly in earnest, has been indeed\nvery profoundly stirred. With one or two others he has started a meeting\nfor prayer in his house, has given up singing his comic songs, and has\nbeen systematically tackling his fellows about their souls' health. Knowing a little bit about the boy, I should scarcely have been able to\nbelieve all this, if Jakes hadn't written to me so very fully about the\nmatter. He is acting quite wisely, I think--has given full permission\nand facilities for their little meetings, with a gentle word or two\nabout the inadvisability of too much publicity. Nevertheless a certain\namount of natural, and, as I can't help feeling, healthy hostility has\nsprung up against the movement--a hostility that we both fear is being\ninterpreted by the boys, and their spiritual adviser, as persecution for\ntheir Lord's sake. I doubt if you'll understand much of this. Your temperament has always\nbeen too downright, too untroubled with spiritual questionings, too\nsimply aware of the \"things we don't talk about.\" \"Isn't this all rather\nlike cant?\" I can imagine you wondering.",

But it isn't by any means all\ncant. And that is what makes the whole question so difficult to deal\nwith. For into the warm nest of the boy's soul this holy blunderer has\nthrust his easy, ignorant fingers, pulling out, as it were, the\nfledgling spiritual secrets. They were not ready for the air and the\nlight and the winds. They were tucked away, as a wise Nature meant them\nto be, under the protecting feathers of the natural boy's carelessness. And now, since they have been plucked out into the open for all the\nworld to see, they must needs flap their premature wings in a sort of\npitiful, earnest foolishness. While we, who know so well what has really\nhappened, can only stand by, at whatever cost, to see that the\nhalf-sprouted pinions may not beat themselves into some permanent\ndistortion or futility--may become, after all, those strong, supporting\nstructures that they were designed for at their birth. And all the while there will be the ever-present danger of the natural\nboy himself discovering suddenly, in a dumb sort of way, that his\nfledgling has been making (as he will most certainly put it) a little\nfool of itself. And then how desperately likely will he be to disown it\naltogether, to his lifelong incompleteness. Self-constituted missioners\nto schoolboys should be required to possess a licence. And it should be\npretty difficult to obtain. Claire you will still find, I think, when you come home next autumn,\nvery much of the pure child, for all her fifteen and a half years. Hockey and Henty bound her physical and mental horizons, and she writes\nperiodical letters to Tom urging the army as the only possible\nprofession for him. And now I must put a stop to what will seem in your\nbachelor eyes the prosy outpourings of the typical family man. But then\nyour Kashmir precipices are not for all of us, you know; and I have only\njust been giving you what you asked for. Yours as ever,\n PETER HARDING. P.S.--There will of course be a spare bedroom and a well-stoked fire\nhere against your return next October.",

    "text": "V\n\n_To Hugh Pontrex, Villa Rosa, Mentone._\n\n 91B HARLEY STREET, W.,\n _March_ 23, 1910. MY DEAR HUGH,\n\nOur exchange of letters, since you finally left our fickle climate, has\nbecome so regular that I would apologise for not having written to you\nsince the New Year, were it not that by so doing I should be distilling\nthe poison of formality into the pot-luck of our correspondence. So I\nwon't. I am sorry to hear that the bronchitis has been bothering you again,\njoining hands with _anno Domini_ to remind you of our human frailty. But\nyour fingers, I see, have lost none of their cunning, and I immensely\nenjoyed your little exhibition of etchings at Obach's. Two of them I\nhave acquired, I am glad to say, and they are looking at me as I write. And now I almost think that I shall have to take a third. It has drifted\ninto Obach's window, and for several days past its fascination has been\ngrowing upon me. Three or four times in passing I have paused to\nconsider it; and on each occasion it has brightened far more than Bond\nStreet for me. It is the drawing of the little flower-girl who has forgotten her wares\nto feast her eyes upon the silk gown in the shop-window. And there was a\ntime, I think, when an older, or younger, Pontrex would rather have\nscorned to descend upon so well-worn a theme--it would have seemed a\ndescent in those days. And at first I thought that even now you had\nthrown it in among the others as a kind of sop to the easy sentiments of\nthe majority. But I have learned better, I think, and discovered that\nyou have treated what is, after all, the perennially beautiful with all\nyour own scrupulous severity. I met such a little girl only to-day in Aldgate. She was not selling\nflowers, and was singularly northern in type--coming home, I should\nguess, from afternoon school. Moving mechanically through the maze of\nhurrying passengers, she was obviously as deaf to the street-side\ncosters as to the more thunderous traffic of the dock-yard waggons. At\nthe corner of Houndsditch we almost collided, and she looked up for a\nmoment from her book. It was a healthy and piquant little face, if\ntypically town-bred, that she turned towards mine. But the look, if I\ncould have captured it on canvas, would have done more than immortalise\nus both. For there was reflected in it--just for a moment--the very\ndazzle itself of that authentic Wonder which some of us call Mysticism,\nand some Romance; but which is only half named by them both. And I\nshould greatly have liked to ask her what book had wrought the miracle. But the currents of crossing pedestrians separated us almost instantly,\nthough not so quickly as the look itself had bolted back into hiding,\nleaving in its stead a very ordinary little schoolgirl extending the tip\nof a small pink tongue. \"'Ullo, fice,\" she said. So I blessed her, and went on my way rejoicing; and was quite ignorant,\nfor at least a quarter of an hour, of the very gorgeous pageant of smoke\nand sunset that faced me towards Cheapside. For, like yourself, it is\nalways the humanity that these things frame that captures me first and\nholds me longest. And I believe I would exchange any merely physical\npanorama in the world for a new vista of the human soul. So greatly\nindeed is this preference growing in me that, keenly as I love it, I\nfind my English landscape already rearranging itself in my memory. Where\nit was once punctuated by trees or monuments or natural wonders, it is\nnow becoming mapped out for me by such trivial affairs as some passing\nword of greeting or chance exchange of easy gossip. At this bend of the\nroad I met the decidedly tipsy old rascal who assured me that he had\nmade his d\u00e9but with Henry Irving. By that hedge two little girls gave me\na spontaneous, and consequently very sweet, small handful of half-ripe\nblackberries. So your little flower-seller has gone to my heart; and if Esther will\nlet me--and I think that she will--I shall take her into my house as\nwell. Can I tell you more than this? My opinion on your technique is not\nworth having, as you know very well. I only know that I am less\nconscious of it in these latest etchings of yours than in any of the\nothers; and that too ought to count for praise, I think. And in any case\nI mean it as such. For indeed it is rather refreshing just now to be\nable, for once in a way, to ignore technique, or at any rate so\nunconsciously to take it for granted that the message conveyed by it at\nonce, and alone, fills the mind. Because, _entre nous_, I seem lately to\nhave diagnosed in most of our galleries a small epidemic of--shall we\nsay?--hypertechnique. The origin of the malady cannot, I think, be very\ndeep-seated. But its outward and visible signs are rather striking\neruptions of a polymorphic type, for the most part somewhat grotesque,\nand not infrequently even a little nauseous. And they are very modern. Nothing quite like them has ever been seen before; unless--can it be\npossible?--every age has known them, but time, in his mercy, has hidden\nthem in due season--a reflection that is not without a certain comfort,\nsince its corollary suggests the same process as being at work\nto-day--unobtrusively, no doubt, but with equal certainty. As Wensley\nsaid to me last week, if the authorities could only be induced to put\nup, for example, Velasquez' Philip IV, or The Laughing Cavalier among\nthe annual exhibits of the New English Art Club, even the most\ncompletely self-satisfied of Mr. John's young ladies would call out for\na catalogue to cover her nakedness.",

But, alas, Philip IV remains where\nhe is, and the neo-intellectuals of the art-world still perspire\nadmiration round their master's most recent visions, to drift hence, in\ndue season, that they may do homage to those \"obscenities in lavender\"\non the one hand, and the Bedlamite echoes of Van Gogh on the other, that\nemerge annually from Paris to soil our walls in the name of progress. Poor Wensley, he is still chipping away at his unprofitable marble,\nspending two years over a group that his conscience forbids him to\nfinish in as many months. Every year there are rumours that the Chantrey\ntrustees are to buy something from his studio. And every year they just\nfail to do so for varying reasons. Poor Wensley, if ever a genius cut\nlife out of marble (and will never, I'm afraid, cut marble out of life)\nit is he, hammering his years away in the purlieus of Chelsea. I have\nseen a good deal of him lately, and once I am fairly inside his studio\nfind it very hard to escape those siren hands of his white-limbed men\nand maidens under a good two hours. His group for this year's Academy,\nif he has been able to finish it, will be as good as, if not better\nthan, anything that he has yet done, I think. May the gods be kind to\nhim, for he needs their pity in more ways than one. He is too good to be\nallowed to fritter his life away in illustrating nursery books and\nrepairing mediocre saints; and there are times when one cannot help\nfeeling that his long knocking at the gates of official appreciation is\nmaking him just a little bitter--brief times, for the next moment his\neye will be bright again and his smile so boyish as to make his fifty\nyears of struggle seem almost mythical. Leaving him there, with his beautiful, unwanted works about him, I\nalways encounter a certain wave of spiritual depression. For, look where\none will, one's eyes would seem to be confronted only with the\ngrotesque, the degenerate, the pernicious; so much so that it becomes\nhard to realise them merely as the little unworthy successes of a very\npassing hour. Our newest music would appear fain to wed itself to the\nobscene imaginings of a decadent poesy, to find its loftiest inspiration\nin pathological versions of Elektra and Salome. Our latest dances seek\nto lift into the very publicity that he lives for the erotic beastliness\nof some such vicious weakling as a Parisian apache. Our most up-to-date\nnovels probe the labyrinths of sexual perversity at a shilling a time\nunder the banner of an emancipated virility, and our Sunday newspapers\nreap the dung-hills for their headlines. By this time, if it is on foot, my middle-Victorianism will nearly have\nreached South Kensington Station, or, if it has been driving, Carter's\nrosy-gilled countenance will be at the carriage-door wondering why it\ndoesn't get out. And so the wave will pass over me, and I shall be\nrocking once again upon a more equable ocean. I shall behold your little\nflower-girl hungering for her beautiful gown, and beside her\nnine-tenths at least of her brothers and sisters, hands out for the real\nbeauty, and entirely impervious to the Wildes and the Strausses, the\nBeardsleys, Johns, and Polaires. After all--let us remember it humbly\nwith thanksgiving--these people do not penetrate our homes. They are\ndoled out to us in public. We scan them in galleries. They are momentary\nsensations in the circulating libraries. But we don't live with them. At\nleast I don't think we do, and in one way and another I have seen the\ninsides of a good many different homes. For a man may perhaps\ntemporarily subordinate his sense of decency to a well-meaning desire\nfor artistic fairness. He may accord a judicial word of praise to some\nparticularly masterly portrayal of a libertine's blotches or the pimples\nof a fading courtesan. But he will seldom bear them home in his bosom to\nset up among his _lares_ and _penates_. And since it is by these that we\nmust judge (for they are the heart-judgment of the race), my billow of\npessimism drops behind me and expends itself in foam upon the rocks. No, it is our Thackerays and Fieldings, our Dickenses and Shakespeares,\nthat we still escort, hats off, to the true and formative intimacy of\nour firesides. Our Blyths and Waleses and Victoria Crosses--my\nclassification is mainly themic--are for furtive journeys on the\nunderground, and a hasty burying in obscure corners; where a sanitary\nProvidence no doubt arranges for them some useful and inconspicuous\ndestiny.

She has just been with some rather dull girls (Ah,\nMolly, Molly, they are non-Shavians, I admit, but just talk to them\nabout horses!) to see a play. \"The--_what_ was the name, my dear?\"\n\n\"'The Scarlet Pimpernel,'\" confesses Molly. I look surprised--even incredulous--remembering certain sweeping\ndamnations of a month or two ago. \"But surely,\" I venture timidly,\n\"isn't that the very--er--acme of provincial melodrama?\"\n\nThe words have a strangely familiar sound, and Molly appears to\nrecognise them. \"Of course it is,\" she says. \"I was _taken_ there.\"\n\nThe expression suggests ropes and cart-tails, and I commiserate with her\nappropriately. \"Poor Molly, and of course you--you----\"\n\nBut my courage fails me, and I dare not finish the question. She tosses\nher dark head a little. \"W-well,\" she stammers, and then, being very honest with herself, stops\nshort, and begins to grow a little pink. I gasp, half rising from my\nchair. \"Surely,\" I exclaim, \"you--you don't mean to say you actually _enjoyed_\nit?\"\n\nThere is a moment's appalled stillness; and then, very rosy, she stoops\nsuddenly to kiss my forehead. \"Daddy,\" she says, \"you're an old _beast_.\"\n\n Ever yrs.,\n PETER HARDING.",

    "text": "VI\n\n_To Miss Sarah Harding, The Orphanage, Little Blessington, Dorset._\n\n 91B HARLEY STREET, W.,\n _March_ 31, 1910. MY DEAR SALLY,\n\nIf the proprietors of a very excellent emulsion of cod liver oil did not\nsend me (as they do) a little memorandum book at the beginning of each\nyear, I should find letter-writing to my sister considerably more\ndifficult. The book is not spacious enough to be called a diary, and the\nlines allotted to each day are merely sufficient to contain the baldest\nrecords of two or three dry facts. But while it is less than a diary,\nfor the keeping of which, if it weren't for you, I'm afraid that I\nshould never have had even the desire, it is entirely valuable as a\nmeans to an end. And may the aforesaid proprietors wax therefore as fat\nand well-liking as their advertised babies. For although you may never\nhave thought of it, oh sister mine, it was by no means an easy condition\nthat you imposed upon me in exchange for your consent to my wedding. \"One letter a month, Peter,\" I can see your stern uplifted finger even\nnow, \"one letter a month you must faithfully promise me, or Esther shall\nonly capture you over my dead body.\"\n\nAnd although in those glorious days it seemed but a little bargain to\nset one's hand to, yet I may now reveal to your horrified gaze--as\nregards the pre-emulsion period at any rate--visions of a haggard\nphysician battering his cranium in a desperate effort to jog his memory\nfor news. A little reflection will secure you from considering this to\nbe an affront. For the very existence of such visions is the most\neloquent testimony to the state of his brotherly affections; and to\nprevent your instantly taking the next train to town, I can assure you\npositively that the wing of a merciful providence (the liver wing) took\nhim under its protection at the psychological moment. Thanks to the cod,\nits oil, and the emulsion thereof, his memory has been propped up just\nwhen he began to need it most. And this is why I can assure you most\npositively that, although ourselves and our daffodils are shrivelling\nto-day in the bitterest of easterly winds, but three short weeks ago we\nwere picking primroses in the woods of Upper Basildon. We were staying of course with Uncle Jacob, who was celebrating his\nseventy-sixth birthday and the fourth anniversary of his retirement from\nthe judicial bench in contravening all the known rules of health--or, at\nany rate, the modern conception of them. Esther and Molly went down on\nthe Friday night, and I joined them on Saturday, his birthday. It was a lovely warm morning, with just enough briskness in the air to\nremind one that winter was still fighting a rearguard action, and just\nenough warmth in the sun to make one quite certain that it would end in\na general defeat. Slipping into Portland Road Station in golfing kit, I\ncaught an early train at Paddington, and was down at Goring soon after\nten, where Esther and Molly met me in the pony-trap. We were to spend\nthe day upon some private links upon the downs above Streatley, a\nbeautiful, invigorating piece of country, and an offshoot, I think, of\nthe Berkshire Ridgeway. From a strictly golfing point of view the course\nis, I suppose, an easy one. To players like myself, of the occasional\norder, too delighted at achieving anything that may decently be called a\nstroke to mind very much about a little pulling or slicing, the\npenalties, no doubt, are scarcely severe enough. But there are\npossibilities, at any rate, of some grand, exhilarating drives; the\ngreens are capital; and there is seldom the nerve-racking ordeal of\nplaying off before a multitude of cynical observers. Instead, this particular course is filled for me with memories of\nelemental foursomes, innocent of caddies, unwitnessed by any living\ncreature other than some simple sheep or an occasional pony, but filled\nto the brim with such dramatic fluctuations of chance and skill as are\nunknown to (or at any rate unremembered by) your poor plus 1 players at\nRichmond or St. Andrews. For golf, like her fairer sister cricket,\nreveals her wild and fickle heart in a truer lovableness at such places\nas this. Kneeling on immaculate turf, you may salute her queenly\nfinger-tips at Hoylake or Sandwich or Rye--as her sister's at Lord's. But to know her as she is--to know them both as they really are--to\nsnatch kisses from their sweet and rosy lips, to look deep into their\nhonest, if baffling eyes, you must woo them, afar from fashion, by\nbrae-side and village green. And yet--and yet--well, perhaps that's just how we duffers always did\ntalk. Like amateur mountaineers, we are fain to conceal our lack of\ncraft in an admiration of extraneous circumstances--such as the view,\nfor instance. And indeed the view from almost any of these particular\neighteen holes is of the most comforting type that I know--a wide,\npastoral expanse, silvered here and there with water, and apparently\nmelting upon its horizons into a veiled and delicate endlessness. Upon\nsuch a view I would quite willingly close my eyes for the last time. And\nwhen the day comes for me to retire it will be to the arm of some such\nwestward hill as this that I shall trust my ag\u00e9d pilgrimage. Grindelwald, Como, Cap Martin--they are good enough company for a mile\nor two of the road. To have known them has been a real privilege, and to\nmeet them again would be an equal joy. But for the long, all-weathers'\ntramp, for the comfortable silences of true comradeship, and above all\nfor those last hobbling footsteps of the journey, give me some little\nhill like this above English cornlands.",

And, taking everything into consideration, I can really find very little\nin the way of an emotional demand that the view, for example, from the\nfourth hole of this particular course doesn't amply satisfy. For eyes\nnecessarily accustomed to close studies and narrower outlooks there is\nspace enough and to spare, and grandeur too, if they are content to\naccept it from above rather than below, and to feast upon those\nheavenly Himalayas and ethereal Pacifics that Nature and a south-west\nwind will always provide for the untravelled. As an echo, or perhaps\nfountain, of which sentiments let me extract for you three verses from a\nweekly paper upon my table. They are entitled--it is the Prayer Book\nheading of the traveller's psalm--\"Levavi oculos.\"\n\n Mahomed, when the mountains stood\n Aloof from his so strong desire,\n Mahomed, being great and good--\n And likewise free--concealed his ire. And since their will might not be bent,\n Mahomed to the mountains went. I too, a clerk in Bedford Row,\n Long years the mountains yearned to see,\n And since to them I could not go,\n Besought that they might come to me. \"If Faith,\" I said, \"can mountains move,\n How surely should they come for Love.\"\n\n And lo, to-day I watch them crowd,\n Range upon range, above my head,\n Cordilleras of golden cloud,\n And snow-white Andes, captive-led,\n Yea, Himalayas, crowned with snow,\n Above my head in Bedford Row. Wiser than Mahomed, like this little clerk, I begin to think that I can\nsee myself enthroned, in my retirement, and letting my mountains be\nbrought to my door. Moreover to old age, a little timid of loneliness,\nsuch a view as this would be completely reassuring. Cottages,\nmanor-houses, Oxford with her dreaming spires, they are all contained\nwithin its broad and kindly grasp. Life, human life, trivial, cheery,\npart and parcel of the ages, has not here been sacrificed to any merely\nscenic splendour; while beneath it, if still flowing through it, lies\nthe fierce and jovial memory of Briton and Saxon and Dane, their frames\nlong since a part of this quiet crucible, and all but the heroic of\ntheir memories--a peaceable reflection--distilled into oblivion. Yes, one might do a great deal worse, I think, than retire to Streatley. At any rate that is Uncle Jacob's opinion, and he has been there a year. \"View?\" he remarked, when I pointed it out to him, \"God bless my soul,\nit's the finest view in England. Let me see, where are they? Aha, just\nthere. No, that's not them. _There_ they are--the Wittenham Clumps. My\nhonour, I think. Fore!\"\n\nWhen you have stayed here so long as an afternoon and evening, you will\nperceive that as St. Paul's to Ludgate Hill or the cross to Banbury, so\nare the Wittenham Clumps to Streatley. They are, at any rate, its\nsoundest conversational investment. We celebrated the evening with a feast to which Uncle Jacob had bidden\nseveral of his fellow-bachelors--Esther and Molly being the only ladies\nhonoured with an invitation. Uncle Jacob, who has never, I should think,\nfor the last thirty years consumed less than five glasses of port a\nnight, accompanied, upon normal occasions, by two cigars, and followed,\na little later, by a couple of large whiskies-and-sodas, was in great\nform, and very anecdotal. He did full justice to an excellent repast,\nand was knocking at our bedroom door at seven the next morning to summon\nus for early service. \"After that, sir, you may loaf, lounge, practise approach shots in the\ngarden, play billiards, or pick primroses. But every able-bodied person\nmust attend divine service at least once on Sundays while he is a guest\nunder my roof.\" And so there he was, pink from his morning tub, and with\nan autocratic twinkle in an eye as clear as yours. I have often, I'm\nafraid, in a horrid, professional sort of way, contemplated Uncle Jacob,\nwho is typical of a distinct class of prosperous old gentlemen, albeit\nnot a large one. All my training and instincts tell me that he eats too\nmuch, and drinks too much. And I know that, until his retirement, his\nlife, as a county-court judge, was almost wholly sedentary. And yet here\nhe is at seventy-six, cheerful, vigorous, and very pleasantly\nself-satisfied--so apparently sound himself, in fact, as to be perhaps\njust a little bit intolerant of the frailties of others. Personally I am\nalways tempted--a little unfairly, since he is really a trifle\nexceptional--to wield him as a bludgeon over the misguided pates of\nfanatical vegetarians. But, on the other hand, how just as reasonably\nmight not some head-strong _bon viveur_ wield him over mine, who am of\ncourse a preacher of the simple life.",

But, on the other hand, how just as reasonably\nmight not some head-strong _bon viveur_ wield him over mine, who am of\ncourse a preacher of the simple life. No, I think that Uncle Jacob has\nthree things to thank for the blithe appearance that he cuts before the\nworld: his forefathers' healthy and athletic simplicity; the fact that\nboth by temperament and profession he has lived an objective, rather\nthan a subjective, life; and finally the truth--Medicine's most\ncomfortable axiom--that Nature, given half a chance, will always come up\nsmiling. He is lusty _malgr\u00e9 lui_. Apart from this little visit in the country I have been very busy; and\nsome difficult and rather critical cases have tied me to town ever\nsince. Horace, after some hesitation, has decided to take up medicine,\nand is working already for his first and second examinations at\nCambridge, where he will now, I think, stay an extra year. Next month\nEsther and I are snatching a week with old Bob Lynn at Applebrook, when\nyoung Calverley will look after my patients, and I shall, I hope, land\ntrout for a little while instead of fees. Molly is well and very\nstately, biding her time, politically speaking, with a stern eye on Mr. Asquith and a doubtful one on Mr. Balfour. Claire decided after all that\nshe would like to postpone her confirmation until next year. She came up\nfor a week-end, at her mistress's wish, to consult about it. \"You see, Daddy,\" she told me thoughtfully, \"I'm not _frightfully_ keen\non it\"; and then after contemplating her toes for a moment, \"It's not\nthat I want to be wicked exactly, only I like feeling sort of comfy.\"\n\nWhen Mummy came in we had a little talk about it, and it emerged, I\nthink, that being \"comfy\" meant retaining certain rights as to dormitory\nfeasts and midnight expeditions that were believed to be incompatible\nwith the confirmed conscience. Next year it would be different. Well, I\nsuppose next year it will; and having preached her a little sermon,\nwhich she accepted very gracefully, we ended in a compromise. She was to\nbe as good as she could, but need not take the irrevocable step till she\nfelt quite ready for it--somewhere about next Easter. Meanwhile she has discovered Mr. Stanley Weyman, and is doubtful if\nthere is anything in all literature to compare with \"Under the Red\nRobe,\" though one of the girls thinks \"Count Hannibal\" almost as good. Tom's letters are terse, and, as I told you last month, we are still\nrather troubled about him. My love to the orphans, with their proper little plaits and their shiny\ncheeks. And that they may continue to rejoice their matron's heart is\nthe prayer of\n\n Her affectionate brother\n PETER.",

    "text": "VII\n\n_To Harry Carthew, Trenant Hotel, Leeds._\n\n 91B HARLEY STREET, W.,\n _April_ 8, 1910. MY DEAR CARTHEW,\n\nI believe every word you tell me about yourself--that you are feeling,\nthat is to say, pumped-out, uncertain, doubtful each morning if you can\nget through the day without breaking down, and as a result of it all,\nvery wretched and depressed. At the same time I can only assure you, and\nI think you must accept my word as a trained man, that you are\nphysically sound, and indeed at this very moment a \"first-class life.\"\n\nI know how difficult it is to believe all this when one is suffering as\nyou are now. But believe me, it is the gospel truth, and one that you\nmust reiterate daily, and if need be hourly, to yourself. Remember that\nall this is just a phase of experience. Twelve months from now you will\nbe laughing at the memory of it. Twelve years hence it will have ceased\neven to be a memory. And if you could only observe your troubles from\nwithout, as I do, you would see at once how very understandable they\nare. For here are you, a busy enough barrister at all times, plunging\nheadlong into the sea of electioneering, from which, after a very stormy\nmonth or two, you emerge to find heavy arrears of work awaiting you at\nchambers, to say nothing of two unexpectedly prolonged and arduous cases\nin the courts. In addition to these things you have been, as you tell\nme, caught up a little in the present whirlwind of rubber speculation,\nand have had rather disquieting reports of Eric's health in Switzerland. Now I know you to be a healthy disbeliever in drugs, the possessor of a\nscepticism, in this respect, that I largely share. And I'm not going to\nwind up this letter with a prescription. But you tell me that your cases\nare now well in hand, and that you have four clear days before the Leeds\nSessions begin; and therefore, if you will let me, I am going to assume\nthe sceptre of the autocrat, and commandeer them for your good. First,\nthen, select a bedroom with a south aspect, and have your bed pulled up\nbeneath the window in such a manner that, being propped up with pillows,\nyou can survey some little portion of the outside world. Having done\nthis, prepare to stop in it for thirty-six hours. The preparation will\nbe simple. Procure a round table and a selection of suitable books. What\nthese should be I daren't prescribe. Let me suggest widely that most of\nthem should deal rather with abstracts than concretes, that some of them\nshould therefore be books of poetry, but that a volume of Jacobs'\nstories should by all means be included. Select one newspaper only, and\nthat of an unsensational character. Let me recommend, without prejudice\nto political convictions, the \"Morning Post.\" As regards Eric, consign\nhim mentally, as you have done actually, to the wisdom of his headmaster\nand the school doctor. And for the rest, commend your affairs to the\ndiscretion of your broker. Now as to diet--for twenty-four hours you\nmust live on milk, and milk alone, no matter how hungry you may become. The hunger will by no means be hurtful, and you can console yourself by\nremembering that your bodily tissue-waste, while in bed, will be\ncomparatively small. So much for the first day. For breakfast, upon the\nsecond, have a bowl of bread and milk. Lunch in bed on some sole or\nplaice, followed by a rice pudding and some stewed fruit. Rise at three,\nspend an hour in the garden if the day is warm enough, and have tea at\nhalf-past four. Being in the provinces, this meal may be accompanied by\ntwo boiled eggs without creating undue attention. Have a warm bath,\nfollowed by a cold sponge-down, at seven o'clock, when you must retire\nto bed, supping on bread and milk at half-past eight, and taking\nthereafter some effective, but not too violent aperient, such as five\ngrains of calomel, let us say, an hour later. On the third day, having breakfasted in bed upon a cup of tea, two\nrounds of buttered toast and a boiled egg, you may rise at eleven, and\ntake an hour's walk. For lunch you should have some boiled fish,\npotatoes, stewed fruit and custard. In the afternoon you should take\nanother hour's walk, and have a cup of tea and some toast at half-past\nfour. Dine in your room at half-past seven upon some clear soup, sole, a\nnicely grilled chop with some mashed potatoes, and any sort of sweet\nthat you may fancy. Having dined, drink a cup of coffee, and smoke your\nfirst cigar among your fellow-men downstairs. Upon the fourth day,\narise, and have a cold tub. Don some old and comfortable tweeds, eat the\nbiggest breakfast of which you are capable, seize a stout stick, take an\nearly train, and spend the day in the country, eating when and what you\nlike, and drinking, if you can get it, some good home-brewed ale. Go to\nbed early, and I will promise you that, upon the morning of the fifth,\nyou will arrive in court at any rate relatively cheerful. A fortnight's\nholiday, when the sessions are over, will complete the good work. Yrs. very sincerely,\n PETER HARDING.",

    "text": "VIII\n\n_To John Summers, M.B., at Actonhurst, Granville Road, Bristol._\n\n 91B HARLEY STREET, W.,\n _April_ 12, 1910. MY DEAR JACK,\n\nI expect that, by this time, a good long night and twenty-four hours'\nreflection will have restored your equanimity. For I can't imagine that\nmuch more would be necessary, although I can sympathise, with a very\nsincere fellow-feeling. Bless you, my boy, it's happened to all of\nus--and goes on happening too, if that's any comfort to you. Why even young Calverley, who was in here just now, and who looks, as\nyou know, almost supernaturally solemn for his five-and-thirty years,\nwas the victim of a similar experience only last week, under\ncircumstances far less considerate than yours. For the old lady--the\nscene was somewhere near Cadogan Square, and it was his second\nvisit--received him in person, sitting very bolt upright. \"You're very young,\" she told him. \"I _don't_ like you. And you don't\nunderstand my case.\"\n\nSo you see your experience has not been by any means unique; and I\nreally don't think that you have any ethical ground for complaint. The\nlady considered you, quite erroneously of course, to be too\ninexperienced, and having told you so in a letter that is by no means\nungraceful, has called in another practitioner. He may be, as you say,\nan ignorant old rotter. But that is irrelevant. And the fact that you\nare a locum tenens doesn't, I think, alter the situation. After all, we are merely the servants of the public, in spite of our\nM.D.'s and our hospital appointments. And we must face the fact with as\nmuch philosophy as we can gather about us. If they don't want us, well,\nthey won't have us, and there's the bitter end of it. Coming fresh from\nthe hospital, where one has been, perhaps, a house-surgeon or\nhouse-physician, into the entirely different atmosphere of private\npractice, it is sometimes a bit hard to realise this, and the process is\nalways a painful one. For between the house-surgeon, clad in white,\nbacked up by the accumulated authority and tradition of his hospital,\nsurrounded by satellite nurses, and perhaps (dare I breathe it?) a wee\nbit lordly, and the very young man, in a new frock-coat, who will be\nushered next week by a curious parlour-maid into a private drawing-room,\nthere is all the difference in the world. Moreover you seem to have got yourself into the sort of practice that\nfor a young man is perhaps the most difficult to manage--a practice\nconsisting almost entirely of prosperous and middle-class patients. I am\nnot using the term middle-class--it is one that I particularly hate--in\nany derogatory sense, but _faute de mieux_ as describing the very large\nstratum of society that pivots upon the shop-counter or the offices\nbehind it. It is a stratum, as you will be sure to find out pretty soon,\nas kindly, honest, and really considerate as any other, and no less\nlacking in heroism and endurance. But it is one that has not yet fully\nacquired perhaps the habit of emotional suppression--the latest to be\ndeveloped in social evolution--and is consequently a little addicted to\nsuperlatives, and still somewhat over-respectful, no doubt, to such mere\nexternals as eloquence and millinery in other people. On the other hand\nit possesses an extremely accurate appreciation of the cash value of\nservices rendered, and its consideration for a gentleman is by no means\ngoing to interfere with this when he comes before them as a salesman of\nphysic and incidentally of advice. Moreover--and it's no good being\nhypersensitive about it--we mustn't forget that we too, as a profession,\nhave but lately differentiated ourselves from the ranks of retail\ncommerce--so lately, in fact, that the barber tradition is far from\nbeing entirely defunct. I can remember very well, for instance, in my first locum, a fortnight\nafter I had qualified, standing behind the counter of a little surgery\nin Shadwell in response to a patient who had tapped upon it loudly with\nthe edge of his shilling, and summoned me with a call of \"Shop.\" Would I\ntake out his tooth for sixpence? No, I wouldn't. A shilling was the\nrecognised fee for this operation. Well, what about ninepence? No, not\neven for ninepence. \"Orl right, guv'nor, 'eave away then,\" and the shilling went into the\ntill, while the tooth, neatly wrapped in paper, was borne homewards for\ndomestic inspection. Nor are such incidents by any means uncommon even\nto-day, and they add excellent lessons to those of Winchester and New. Then, too, you mustn't overlook the fact that mere youth itself is under\na greater disadvantage in medicine than in almost any other profession. The idea of a young advocate may fire the imagination. The idea of a\nyoung doctor only suggests distrust. A young lawyer, having the keener\nwit of youth, may be a safe adviser in our legal dilemmas. The young\nofficer is the marrow of our army and navy. We may even venture to\nentrust our souls for spiritual guidance to some earnest young priest. But when it comes to our bodies, to the actual tenements that contain\nus, to such intimate events as percussion, palpation, the administration\nof tonics, or the insertion of knife and forceps--why then, you know, we\nmust really insist upon maturity. Your mere boys may administer our properties, or defend our countries,\nor even dally gently with our souls. But when it comes to our actual\nflesh and blood--well, we prefer the assistant or the locum to confine\nhis attentions to the servants, the children, or the very poor. There\nare exceptions to the rule, no doubt. But I'm afraid that you will find\nit a very general one. I know that I did. And about the only comfort to\nbe extracted from it is the fact that it may be regarded as an excellent\nmedium for the acquirement of humility.",

For their teaching, in this respect, is not likely, I think, to be more\nthorough than yours. At the same time, there are, as you have just been\nfinding out, some rather bitter moments for the newly fledged medico. I\nremember once, when I was about twenty-four, I think, and doing a locum\nin Portsmouth, being called up for the third night in succession to\nattend a confinement. It was three o'clock in the morning, and the\nnight-bell stirred me out of the profoundest depths of slumber. Very\nweary, and very bleary, I remember cursing myself by all my gods for\nhaving set my hand to so laborious a plough as the pursuit of healing. But later, walking grimly down the empty streets in a pallid drizzle of\nrain, a certain sense of heroism came to my rescue. After all, it _was_\nrather a noble thing to be doing; and no doubt my patient would be\nproportionately grateful. As a matter of solemn fact, on setting eyes\nupon me, she lifted up her voice, and wept incontinently. It was a perfectly natural thing to do, of course, in the light of after\nreflection. She had expected to see the genial, middle-aged physician\nwho had so often attended her; and behold, in his stead, a pale-faced\nboy who might very nearly have been her son! It was no wonder that she\nburst into tears. But it was rather a blow for the poor hero. Afterwards, I think, having both made the best of a bad job, and\nobserved an all-wise Nature introduce to us an entirely normal baby, we\nbecame quite friendly. And you will generally find, if you know your\nwork, and refrain from dogma, that a little patience will heal most of\nthese differences, while the cause of them, alas, will depart readily\nenough. It is good, no doubt, to be considered a wise old codger. But\nthe pearl that pays for it is of great price. So don't be in too much of\na hurry to part with it. Your affect. uncle,\n PETER HARDING.",

    "text": "X\n\n_To the Rev. Bruce Harding, S. Peter's College, Morecambe Bay._\n\n 91B HARLEY STREET, W.,\n _April_ 20, 1910. MY DEAR BRUCE,\n\nThe whole subject is so difficult, and one's opinions upon it, in cold\nink as it were, are so liable to be misread, that I wish we could have\nhad a quiet talk about it instead. But of course, since you cannot leave\nthe school until the May holiday begins, and will have, if you decide to\ntake so radical a step, to write to the boys' parents in India and\nEgypt, this is quite impossible. From your letter I seem to gather that\nthis was your intention at the time of writing, and it is a decision in\nwhich I can sympathise with you very deeply. For the whole ten years during which the school has been in your charge\nit has, to your almost certain knowledge, and according also to the\ntestimony of many of your old pupils, been absolutely free from this\n\"moral canker,\" as you describe it, that you have just discovered in it\nnow. And even for a preparatory school, like yours, this is a record for\nwhich you are right to be profoundly thankful. It is one also that\nnaturally throws up into a blacker relief the present condition of\naffairs. Moreover, having discovered its sphere to be at present fairly\ncircumscribed--confined apparently to a single coterie of some half a\ndozen boys--the obvious course, as you say, would seem to be a prompt\nand thorough excision, _pro bono publico_. And yet I believe that there's a better way--so much better that I am\nsure, before receiving this, you will have already found it, and\nabandoned your first decision. You won't expel the youngsters. You'll\ncreate instead a public feeling that will cure them. And you'll\ndistribute them in such a way that each will be surrounded by it to his\nbest advantage. I feel so certain that you'll have already made up your\nmind to do this that I won't put in any special pleading on behalf of\nthese particular nippers or their parents abroad, although I sincerely\nbelieve that in taking so drastic a step as you suggest in your letter\nyou would not only be magnifying their offence out of all proportion,\nbut that the result all round would be more than harmful. Instead, the point that I would most urgently put before you--in spite\nof many an old drawn battle upon the subject--is that the present little\ncrisis would be an excellent excuse for reconsidering your position as\nregards giving to your scholars some definite physiological instruction. Because I am quite convinced that at least three-quarters of your moral\ncanker would more properly be defined as physiological curiosity and\nthat the whole problem is only secondarily one of actual perversity. Now\nyour custom up to the present has had, I'll admit, a great deal to\nrecommend it. For your boys come to you very young, usually at the age\nof nine or ten, shy and imaginative enough perhaps, but for the most\npart mentally sexless, and with an almost entirely objective outlook\nupon life. In other words, their inquisitiveness is eccentric rather\nthan concentric. It's a happy condition, and one, as you say, that must\nbe dealt with exceedingly carefully. When they leave you, somewhere\nabout fourteen or fifteen years old, you usually take the opportunity of\nthe good-bye interview to give them some warnings as to confronting\nmoral dangers. But purposely, for fear of prematurely dissipating a\ndesirable innocence, or awakening what you call an illegitimate\ncuriosity, you keep your advice to generalities in all but the rarest\ninstances. The possible stimulus to dangerous self-exploration in some\nunsuspecting youngster has always outweighed for you the advantages of a\ntoo direct explanation. And this is where, in spite of your ten years' immunity, I feel sure\nthat your methods have fallen short of the best. Self-exploration is\nonly dangerous when it's blind, and if self-curiosity is ever\nillegitimate--and I don't see why it should be--we both know that some\nday or another it is going to become inevitable. We know more, because\nwe are fully aware that some day or another it is going to be satisfied. And for the life of me I cannot see why mere physiological ignorance\nshouldn't be dispelled in the same routine that is employed for\ndispelling any other sort of ignorance, mathematical, historical, or\nwhat you will. It can be done, I am quite certain, without rubbing a\nparticle off the sweet bloom of childhood, and it will go a very long\nway in preserving from a much ruder handling that of adolescence and\nearly manhood. For it seems to me that the very fact of refraining from\nany definite instruction upon what, after all, from the purely physical\npoint of view, is the bed-rock of our _raison d'\u00eatre_, lends the\nsubject in advance precisely that air of unnecessary and even shameful\nmystery which is responsible for about nine-tenths of our prudery on the\none hand, and our obscenity on the other. There's so little original in these reflections, they represent the\nattitude of so large a number of ordinarily thoughtful persons, that\nthey may probably bore you. But, on the other hand, although there's a\ngood deal of educational spade-work still before us, the day will\ncertainly come, I think, when we shall treat and teach sexual phenomena\nin the same sane and self-consciousless way as we treat and teach the\nprinciples of personal cleanliness and physical hygiene. It will be a\ngreat day--may it come soon--and with its dawning will disappear not\nonly the entire stock-in-trade of a not uncommon type of smoking-room\nraconteur, but a very considerable portion of actual and imaginative\nimmorality. For if you cover up anything long enough, and refer to it\nslyly enough, you can be certain in the end of making its exposure\nindecent.",

If gloves became _de rigueur_ for a couple of centuries we\nshould raise prurient titters at the mention of a knuckle. No; it's air\nand sunlight and the salt of a bracing sanity in these matters that is\nour crying need. \"The sea,\" says Mr. Stacpoole in his clever romance \"The Blue Lagoon,\"\n\"is a great purifier,\" and proceeds, in a little piece of delicate and\nabsolutely true psychology, to describe how Dick, the derelict boy on\nthe coral island, instinctively ran naked with his sister in the\npresence of winds and waves, although some impulse, born probably of\nmemory, bade him cover himself inland. But his decency was the same in\neither place. And it's the sea air of a healthy knowledge and acceptance of these\nmatters that we ought to be pumping through our schoolrooms, our\ndormitories, and our heart-to-heart talks with our children. Approach\nthem frankly enough, and with no semblance of shamefacedness, and we\nneedn't be afraid, I think, of any evil consequences. The guilty smile,\nthe illicit joke, become disarmed in advance when their subject is\ntreated in the same matter-of-fact and unmysterious fashion as those of\ngeography or astronomy. And that is why, on the whole, I am opposed to\nthe average \"purity\" volumes that are published for purposes of sexual\ninstruction. For though they acknowledge this to be the solution of a\nlarge portion of the problem, they are so written, circulated, and\nadvertised as to suggest rather an initiation into the unspeakable than\na straightforward piece of natural history. And I suspect, as a\nconsequence, that their sales are considerably larger among the prurient\nthan the pious. An older generation was brought up on \"Reading without\ntears.\" The next should have a companion volume \"Biology without shame.\"\n\nForgive this sermon, but I have been confronted just lately with such a\nlot of human mental wreckage, the direct result, in my opinion, of the\nhalf-religious, half-fearful shrouds with which we always swaddle up\nthese questions, that I rejoice in an opportunity for their wholesale\ncondemnation. It was Mrs. Craigie, I think, who said that every girl of\neighteen should read \"Tom Jones.\" And one can see why, for it is a clean\nand wholesome history, if a little unspiritual. But her education, like\nher brother's, should not be left haphazard to the chance reading of a\nnovel, or to the unnecessary blushes with which she ponders certain\npassages of Scripture. Well, good-bye, old man, and God bless you. Chat it all over with the\nyoung sinners, and then work out a little course of lectures upon the\nreproduction of species. If you have never talked collectively to a\nroomful of boys upon the subject before, you will be surprised at the\nrapt interest and genuine solemnity with which they will attend to what\nyou have to tell them. And the purity of your school won't suffer, I\nthink, by its change of foundations. Your affect. cousin,\n PETER HARDING.",

    "text": "XII\n\n_To Tom Harding, c/o the Rev. Arthur Jake Rugby._\n\n 91B HARLEY STREET, W.,\n _April_ 24, 1910. MY DEAR TOM,\n\nI have been expecting this letter of yours for a good many weeks. It\nwould be almost true, I think, to say that I have been hoping for it. And yet each week of delay has been making, I believe, for safety. So\nstrongly have I been feeling this last, indeed, that now your letter has\nactually come, and actually contains to so large an extent the sort of\nmaterial that I expected to find in it, I am more than glad that you\nhave hesitated so long before writing it. One must always stand away a\nlittle from the burning bush to discuss its relations with an everyday\nworld. Close beneath it, in the first apprehension of its significance,\nthere is no room for anything but adoration. And I am afraid this letter\nof mine, had you received it then, would have seemed to you, if not even\na little blasphemous, at any rate lacking in true reverence. For\nalthough you haven't told me so, I expect that I shouldn't be far wrong\nin hazarding a guess that for the first month or two after your\nexperience at Scarborough you told yourself that your father, and\nperhaps even your mother, were a little wanting in a true understanding\nof the miracle that had befallen you. It was all so new, so\noverwhelming; it threw such a strange light not only upon your own\nindividual life, past and to come, but upon the sum total of all other\nlife as well, that you felt its wonder to be almost incompatible with\nthe humdrum, commonplace existence that we and most of our friends\nappeared to be leading. Had we known it, as it was then shining upon you, surely we should have\nbeen so different! You felt, I think, as if you had suddenly found us\nout. And though you didn't love us any the less for this--perhaps even\nloved us more, in another kind of way--you were quite sure that if you\nhadn't actually outstripped us by this single leap into the light, we\nhad at any rate dropped down a little from the high plane on which, till\nthen, you had never doubted that we lived. How, for example, in a world that teemed with sin, could the governor be\nso keen on catching trout? How was it, with these dark, tremendous\nmillions hemming him in, that you had never seen him hand away a tract,\nor preach the Word in season? How came it, alas, that he could even\nsometimes say \"damn\" when he broke a bootlace, or waste some\nunreturnable hour over a rubber of bridge? Of course with the mater it\nwas different. Maters _are_ different, and I'm glad you thought of that,\nTom. But come now, didn't it run somehow in this way? Why naturally it\ndid, and it meant that your discovery had already begotten another. It\nmeant that you had suddenly realised the weak humanity of your parents. But you must try to be kind to it. And that's how it is with all great discoveries, Tom, in every branch of\nlife. First one is struck with their extraordinary, their dazzling,\nsimplicity. Belief--life; acceptance--salvation; and you had never\nsomehow thought of it before! How simple, and by its very simplicity how\ngod-like, how utterly convincing! And then, in this new irrefragable conception, everything (even the\ngovernor) has to be reconsidered, appraised, condemned, readjusted, and\ninspired afresh. What is this going to mean to me personally? What does\nit mean to other people? And again, what responsibility towards them\ndoes its possession entail on myself? These are the inevitable questions\nthat follow. The putting of them is the second stage in the general\nprocess. The very fact of their being put at all shows the discovery to\nbe already at work. And the answers, if the discovery is worth anything\nat all, and we have postulated it to be a great one, can be of only one\nkind. I must pursue it to the end. I must follow out its leading as far\nas my humanity will let me. And I must communicate the results to my\nfellows according to the best of my abilities. That is the third stage,\nand it is coterminous with life, Tom. Because, you see, all great\ndiscoveries, like yours, contain within them the germ-cells of a\nthousand others. To discover one or two of these, to nourish them, and\nperhaps even, if one is very fortunate, to enable them in some degree to\nfructify, is more than a life-work for most of us. So true is this, and so endless and apparently diverse appear to be\ntheir various possibilities, that we are apt very easily (especially in\nmiddle life) to forget the splendid, sweeping simplicity of the initial\nidea, just as we are equally apt to overrate, perhaps, the importance of\nthose particular germs that we have, by temperament and circumstance,\nelected to serve, and to underrate the value of those to which our\nneighbours have been attracted. And it is because of the first of these\nthings that I want to thank you for your letter, and tell you how very\nmuch I value it. You have reminded me again of something that I would\nnever like to forget. You have re-created for me the right atmosphere. Belief _is_ life, Tom, in a great many more senses than one. Hang on to\nthat like a limpet, and the peace of heart that means strength of hand\nwill never leave you. But it's because of the second of these things\nthat I want you to hesitate just a little longer before you commit\nyourself to the proposition in your letter.",

But it's because of the second of these things\nthat I want you to hesitate just a little longer before you commit\nyourself to the proposition in your letter. To be a lay evangelist, something like the gentleman whose services you\nattended, may be as high and noble a life as any that the world has to\noffer you. As I conceive it, lived to its greatest advantage, it must be\nan exceedingly difficult one, which should only of course make it the\nmore worth living. But to say that it is the _best_ worth living, while\nit may be true for yourself, is certainly not true as a general\nprinciple. There is no one sort of life that is the best worth living. And in considering the question, as you certainly must, I think you\nought to be very careful to keep this before your mind. Ways in life\nare not to be selected like articles from a shop-window. You cannot ask\nfor the best, and go away with it in your pocket. The best worth living\nlife is already inside you. And your new discovery is not going to\ndetermine its nature--heredity and a thousand other things have already\ndone that--but rather its quality. You may be cut out for a lay, or any\nother kind of evangelist. I hadn't somehow suspected it in you. But I\nmay easily have been wrong. Yet I think you mustn't take any definite\nvows upon your shoulders--at any rate, for some time--and probably, I\nsuspect, for several years. Promises of this sort, you see, are so very much better left unmade. For\nin the first place, the remembrance of them is more than likely to blur\nthe gladness, and consequent usefulness, with which you will obey your\ntemperament and tendencies in later years, should these determine for\nyou some different course. And in the second, they may even, standing\nupon some mistaken scruple of conscience, succeed in forcing you,\nagainst your real calling, into an altogether unsuitable career. Meanwhile you need have no fears, I think, in leading your normal,\nprobationary life. You have the opportunity of University education\nbefore you. And that, at any rate, can do you no harm, and will probably\nbe of extreme use to you, whatever your ultimate decision. You want to\nfind out the truth, to impart the truth, and to help your fellow-men to\nlead better lives. Very well then, if there's a God, Tom, as you and I\nbelieve, you must be just the material that He would most greatly care\nto use. So why not leave it at that for a little while? Want to do the\nright thing, and so do the next one; and you'll find, I think, that the\nprecise nature of your own particular right thing, evangelist or\nengineer, will pretty certainly settle itself.

    "text": "XIII\n\n_To Hugh Pontrex, Villa Rosa, Mentone._\n\n c/o DR. ROBERT LYNN,\n APPLEBROOK, DEVON,\n _May_ 3, 1910. MY DEAR HUGH,\n\nI have just come back to read your letter from one of those super-days\nof which even the happiest life can contain, I imagine, no more than a\nhandful. Of merely good days I can remember many enough--a sufficient\nnumber, at any rate, to absorb very happily the memory of their less\nfavoured brethren. And several of them remain distinct by virtue of some\noutstanding incident or emotion that they contained or inspired. But\nmost, I think, have become blended into a general peaceable impression\nof past contentment. To use a popular Americanism, they were good times,\nand usually real good times at that. But of these super-days, these Olympians among mundane experiences, no\nman can expect very many, and I have been, I suspect, as fortunate as\nmost--in any case so fortunate as to be more than grateful,\nnotwithstanding the tiny, struggling sense in me (a legacy of\nsuperstition, I suppose, from some far-back ancestors) that so exquisite\nan enjoyment must surely prelude some equivalent disaster. They are not,\nas a rule, I think, critical days, at any rate in the ordinarily\naccepted sense of the term, though I can remember perhaps a couple that\nin a small fashion might answer this description. The first of them was in my fifteenth year, and was the last day (at the\nend of six weeks' strict training) of the House Races at school. Our\nfour had started bottom of the river, and day by day had crept up until,\nin the evening of this particular one, we were to row the favourites,\nSchool House, for the cup. When I call them the favourites, they were\nthis merely in a sporting sense. Because, I think, the succession of\ngood fights put up by our own insignificant little house, added to a\ncertain reputation for conceit that most School Houses would seem to\npossess, had won pretty nearly the whole of the rest of the school to\nour support. As a very junior and inferior oarsman (and I was more than\nconscious of this at the time, I remember) I can claim no particular\nshare, other than an accidental one, in this series of victories. I had\nbeen one of two candidates for the post of bow, and being a few pounds\nheavier than my opponent, had managed to secure the thwart. But my mere\nundeservedness did not lessen--in fact, I think, it enhanced--the almost\nmiraculous sweetness of those wonderful twelve hours. To be gazed at\nsurreptitiously by yet smaller boys in a patently envious admiration; to\nbe patted on the back by older ones who had never hitherto noticed my\nexistence; to be let out of school half an hour earlier by the\nform-master, with a jocose phrase about privileged heroes--all these\nthings wove a magic round my way that no anxiety about the coming race\nwas strong enough to mar, and that has survived a good many years. Of\nthe race itself I can remember, curiously, nothing but the peculiar\nhollow echo of our oars as we came through the Town Bridge, and the bare\nfact that we succeeded in winning, to the supposed vast humiliation of\nour superior enemies. But what I do remember most distinctly is being\ninvited to tea with the captain, a big man and a monitor. It was a\nsplendid, god-like meal, in which the six weeks' abstention (mistaken,\nno doubt, but none the less heroic) from sweets and pastries was\nutterly forgotten. And there stands out to me the doughnut that\ndismissed them to oblivion, a doughnut of so succulent a clamminess that\nit is unlikely, I think, ever to have had its peer--a very Lycidas among\ndoughnuts. The second day that occurs to me is that in which, playing through, for\nthe first time in many years, to the Finals, the Hospital XV was\ndefeated after a gruelling ninety minutes by the team that represented\nGuy's. This must have been some eight or nine years later, and its\nessence is contained in my memory by five perfect minutes, gloriously\nrelaxed, tired but hard, in a hot bath at Richmond. Now looking back, I know these to have been super-days, and they were,\nas I have explained, in a very minor sense critical perhaps. But they\nwere exceptions, I think, to the general rule. For though the critical\nday, the long-looked-forward-to, the apparently, and indeed,\nchronologically speaking, the really important day may be a good one,\nand contain great things, yet in later life, at any rate, there is an\ninseparable anxiety about it of which the super-day knows nothing. The\nday one qualified, for example, and became by one scratch of the pen\nlicensed to sign death-certificates, exempt from serving on fire\nbrigades, and worth (on paper) from three to five guineas a week as a\nlocum tenens, was, no doubt, a notable one. The day one proposed oneself\nin a kind of stammering paralysis as a possible husband to the only\npossible girl--and was unbelievably accepted; the marriage day; the day\nwhen one was appointed to the hospital staff; the day when, in a cool\nand blinded room, one stooped to kiss the tired but joyful eyes of the\nfirst baby's mother--these are the dates over which, most probably, the\noutside historian would choose to pour the vials of his fancy. But I\ndoubt if in any life these are ever the super-days. They are days to\nremember; but at the same time they are days that one is glad to have\nseen closed. They have beheld Destiny too visibly hanging on so\ndesperately fine a balance. No, they come, these gift-days from the gods, even as they list; and\nthey refuse to be classified. The most constant feature about them, I\nthink, is that they rather generally appear during a holiday.",

The most constant feature about them, I\nthink, is that they rather generally appear during a holiday. And this,\nI believe, is because they depend so much on a certain purely bodily\nfitness. I hesitate a little to be very dogmatic about this, because the\nolder one grows the more spiritual, and consequently deeper, becomes\ntheir joy. And yet, for the majority of us, at any rate, I am certain\nthat the temple must be at least in passable order if the spirit within\nis to look abroad with an unworried heart, and thoroughly spring-cleaned\nbefore its householder, free from domestic cares, can roam joyously at\nwill to find those rarer flowers that he's so seldom free enough to\nseek. And there lies my stock argument for all misguided religious\nworkers who won't take holidays, and incidentally the real damnation of\nall systems of monastic self-mortification. A sound body not only means\na sound mind, but an untrammelled spirit. For a spirit that has\nconstantly to be down on its knees stopping up some leak in the basement\ncannot possibly find much time for walking in the garden with God. And\nif it's a self-made or self-permitted leak, it hasn't even the excuse of\nbeing engaged in some equally necessary occupation. Yet apart from this, there isn't a doubt, I think, that these super-days\nstand out in memory, and gain their constructive force less by reason of\ntheir muscular exaltation than by virtue of their spiritual vision. For\neven in the days of the doughnut and the hot bath this last wasn't\naltogether absent. The doughnut marked the closing of an epoch and the\ndawn of its successor. It meant the passage--and to a certain extent\nthe conscious passage, too--of an irresponsible childhood into a region\nof honourable reputation. It was a doughnut that had been bestowed by\nthe hands of a captain. While the hot bath, careless of defeat, merely\nwhispered how great had been the game. And in their successors of later\nyears this spiritual factor has tended to emphasise itself in an\never-growing proportion. Wordsworth might almost have selected the\ntheme, I think, for an Ode on the Intimations of Immortality in Middle\nAge. I can remember one such day on Butser Hill, during a snatched\nweek-end in Hampshire, and another that is summed up for me in a bend of\nheather-bordered road, turning, at a hot day's end, towards\nStronachlacher and a green lawn above Loch Katrine. And now, with an equal unexpectedness, there has come the latest of them\nall. You know how it goes on a holiday--the holiday, that is, of a man to\nwhom holidays are rare and very blessed. For the first day your mind has\nnot yet freed itself from town and toil and the hundred other interests\nfor which they stand. Nor has your body quite overcome the lassitude\ninspired by pavements, and encouraged by taxi-cabs and broughams. Your\nhost, too, wants to learn the latest tidings from the great metropolis;\nwhat So-and-so thinks of the political situation; the prevailing opinion\non stocks and shares; the last pronouncements on art and music; the\nnewest good thing in plays. And perhaps even, if you chance to be of the\nsame profession, you fall to talking shop. Not even the magic of\nplunging streams and deep, rock-shaded pools is quite sufficient, for\nthe moment, to dispel the urban atmosphere that still clings about you. Your unused muscles remind you of the reason for their flabbiness. Your\neye, too long engaged upon other sights, is not yet quick enough to mark\nthe swift rise among those ripples at the tail of the pool. And you\nreturn from your first day's fishing a little annoyed with yourself,\naching as regards the wrist and thigh, and more often than not with a\nlight or empty bag. Yet even so, mark the change in your after-dinner\ntalk! Smoking there round the hall fire, surrounded by rods and guns and\ncases of fish and game, you no longer deliver yourself of opinions on\nthe rubber market or the precise value of the latest vaccine. You\ndiscuss instead the reason why you missed that pounder under Applebrook\nBridge. And you sit for long minutes staring through a blue tobacco haze\ninto the wood-fire's heart, presumably thinking, but in reality doing\nnothing of the kind. For though the gates of your brain are open, it is\nto speed rather than receive impressions. And by to-morrow the\novercrowded hostel of your mind will be standing with doors ajar for its\nlustier moorland visitors. So it has been with me, Hugh, and to-day, the third of my holiday, has\nbeen one of those great ones of which I have been writing. Talking\nsleepily in bed last night to Esther I had announced an intention,\nreceived by her with a discreet appearance of belief, of sallying out\nearly to try a couple of those big pools at the junction of the\nApplebrook and Dart. But the servant with the shaving water found us\nboth comfortably asleep at half-past eight, with two silvery morning\nhours unfished except in dreams.",

But the servant with the shaving water found us\nboth comfortably asleep at half-past eight, with two silvery morning\nhours unfished except in dreams. Dear me, but what a glorious air, and\nhow divine a whisper, too frail to be called a scent, of delicately\nbrowning trout! For old Bob had been up betimes, and, in spite of a powder of frost on\nthe riverside gorse and alders, had succeeded in beguiling half a dozen\nplump little troutlings into providing the _hors-d'oeuvre_ to a\nsubstantial three-decker breakfast. The family had already made their\nmeal, by the time we got downstairs, and old Bob, ruddy and contented,\nsurveyed us approvingly from the hearthrug. \"If the sun didn't find you yesterday,\" he chuckled, \"I fancy the breeze\ndid,\" and Mrs. Bob murmured something to Esther about hazeline ointment. A long round would prevent Bob from doing any more fishing for the rest\nof the day, but a touch of south in the wind had decided him that Esther\nand I must settle upon the East Dart for our third day's sport. \"The wind should help you,\" he said; \"and you ought to have a pretty\ngood time,\" and became forthwith a prophet, though not concerning trout. I'm not going to bother you with details of our angling. It was very\narduous, for the wind changed almost as soon as we had started, and blew\ndown the steep valley at a good many miles an hour. But it was at least\nexciting, and we lunched in a hail-storm on sandwiches and fruit pies,\nconveyed to us across the moor by Nancy on her pony. Do you remember Nancy Lynn, a blush-rose little baby-girl a dozen years\nago? But I'm sure you do, and I wish you could have seen her to-day as\nshe rode down to us along the steep path to the river, straddle-legged\non her Dartmoor pony, bareheaded, and the colour of a ripe\nchestnut--lustiest of little animals, but with eyes, as she cuddled her\npony's nose, that have already learned to spell mother, and sometimes\nwonder what it means. After lunch, Esther went home with her to meet some friends of Mrs. Lynn\nat tea, and I was to fish a mile or two further up stream, returning\nlater in the evening. But smoking my pipe under the stone wall that had\nsheltered our meal, it was a long time before I again took up my rod. And instead I sat there under the clearing sky--a great gulf now of\ntear-washed blue, deepening into an immeasurable calm behind these\ntrivial clouds--and watched the two of them making their leisurely way\nalong the hill. And seen thus, at a little distance, they might very\neasily have been sisters. There was the same spring in their boyish\ntread, and, could I have seen it, I have no doubt that there was the\nsame kind of look in their clear, contented eyes. For what Nancy now\nwas, Esther so obviously once had been. And what Esther had become,\nNancy in her kind would also grow to be--and subtly, to some small\nextent, because of Esther. Indeed it might almost have been Esther as\nshe was, walking pleasantly with Esther as she is, the child's instinct\nof living only each moment's life, clinging happily to the woman's\ndeeper philosophy of doing precisely the same. I wonder if you see what\nI'm driving at. It all looks so commonplace on paper. They were really\nof course two ordinary people, a young girl and a woman, disappearing\ndown a path. But to an elderly physician (a thousand feet up, and on a\nsuper-day, mind you) they seemed suddenly to be something rather more. For swinging hands as they walked, half-way between the changing water\nand the changeless Tor, it was as though now they held visibly between\nthem some mystical arm's-length of the secret core of life--something\nthat was at once common to their age and youth, and was yet apart from\nboth; something, independent of circumstance, that was swinging for a\nbenediction over the years that lay between them. And I'll tell you what\nit was, Hugh, or at any rate what I knew it to be this afternoon. It was\njust the Ultimate Truth about things. And behold it was very good! So that's why I've written you this letter in answer to your sad one of\nthis evening. For though there is said to be a kind of comfort, I believe, in\nrealising that others are suffering like ourselves, I doubt if this is\never a comfort worth having. And, on the other hand, there is a certain\namount of real satisfaction in knowing, at the end of a blank day, that\nyour neighbour, at any rate, has had a bit of luck. And so because you\nwrite to me _de profundis_, your bronchial mucous membrane being more\nthan usually congested, I'm deliberately crowing to you from my little\nhill-top.

    "text": "XIV\n\n_To Miss Molly Harding, 91B Harley Street, London, W._\n\n c/o DR. ROBT. LYNN,\n APPLEBROOK, DEVON,\n _May_ 6, 1910. MY DEAR HOUSEKEEPER,\n\nTwenty years ago your mother and I came down here for a fortnight's\nfishing to stay, just as we are staying now, and in the same month, too,\nwith Bob Lynn and his wife. I remember that we wondered for quite six\nweeks if we could properly afford to do this. The house, you see--not\n91B, but the tiny one at the end of Devonshire Street--had been so very\ncostly in its demand for furniture, for rent, for wear and tear. The\npractice was so uncertain, seemed so desperately slow in growing. Was it\nsafe to leave it? Would it be still there when we returned? And if\nnot----? So we argued, and knew all the time that there was a far more important\nconsideration than any of these tucked away in the upstairs part of our\nminds. Was it safe to leave her at only ten months old? Would she know\nus again when we came back? Could any one in the world take a great\nenough care of her? Perhaps you have never guessed what an important little person she was;\nand perhaps, even now, you decline, in that very calm and unimpassioned\nhabit of yours, to believe it. But that must be because you have never\nproperly studied the evidence. I wonder if you have ever seen, for\ninstance, the clothes that she wore--such little clothes, but just look\nat them, every stitch as delicate as a tendril, and every dimple and\npucker as soft as a wild bird's nest. There's never more than one person\nin the world who can make clothes like that; and nobody, not even her\nhusband, knows where she learned the secret. And if this were only the\nhusk, what then about the plump little kernel inside? I can remember the long discussions, and how at last two cold-blooded\nphysicians, the one in Devonshire and the other in town, had their own\nway, and forced a mother from her babelet for two long, if\nhealth-giving, weeks. I can remember the arrival of a Miss Sarah\nHarding--admirablest of lay-mothers (God bless them all)--to take up her\nawful charge; and the hour or so during which she received instructions\nenough to cause a less iron brain to melt upon its pan. But she was a\nwonderful woman even then, and _somebody_ had to take care of the child. And now, with a trifling difference or two, here's history repeating\nitself in the oddest manner possible, father and mother flown down again\nto Devonshire, and somebody offering, in their absence, to take care of\nMiss Molly--but for rather longer than a paltry two weeks; and please\nwhat do we think of it? By the same post, too, comes a brief, apologetic sort of letter from the\ncandidate himself. He had meant to wait for another year or so before\nsuggesting himself as even a possible caretaker, only as it happened\nlast night at Lady Pearson's she was looking, etc. etc.--and you know\nhow these things will get the better of a chap, etc. etc.--and, well,\nthere it was, don't you know; and now it is all upon the knees of the\ngods. Or of one little goddess, did he mean to say? Because that of\ncourse is where it really is, as you both know very well indeed, in\nspite of your pretty letters to us, which have made your mother and me\nfeel at once very elderly and happy and anxious (in a not too unpleasant\nsense) and also--do you mind?--vicariously honoured. I doubt if I am looking at the matter quite eye to eye with the W.S.P.U. when I say this; but you'll have to forgive me, I think, especially as\nit's your Daddy's opinion that you ask for, and not theirs. So I'll tell\nyou just what I felt when I read your letter, and comprehended its\ntidings. 1. Dear me, is she really as old as that? 2. Then what am I? 3. _O tempus edax rerum!_\n\n4. But it's really rather gratifying. 5. Because after all there are so many nice girls in the world. 6. And yet it's _my_ girl that he would like to marry. 7. _Our_ girl, please. (This from Esther.)\n\nYou see how primitive we become in these little crises of life. And I think, if you really want to have my very particular message to\nyou about this, it is--don't mind being a little primitive yourself. On the whole, perhaps, I am not able to prescribe this as often as I\nshould like; and chiefly because, I suppose, the young couples that come\nto me for an opinion on matrimony are not as a rule normal young\ncouples. They have usually been sent, that is to say, by some wise or\nanxious guardian who has foreseen for them some probable disaster. And\noften enough I have had to beseech them for their own good and for the\nunborn others to let their reason lay aside their passion--not without\ntears. Now, I believe I know you well enough to be right in saying that\nthe--shall I call it the strictly eugenic?--side of the question is not\nlikely to suffer from your neglect. Newnham and the W.S.P.U. will have\ntaken care of that. Nor is there anything, in the present case, to\ntrouble you from this point of view. For Arthur Lynn is a sound,\nhealthy, athletic young man, four years your senior, of good stock and\nsufficiently satisfactory means and prospects. Both physically and in\nevery other way he would be a desirable husband for you. And all this,\nas I gather from your letter, you have been very carefully, and very\nrightly, considering.",

Moreover you can be quite sure--you probably _are_\nquite sure--that there is no one whom your mother and I would sooner\nhave for a son-in-law, as I am writing to tell him this evening. No, my dear, I don't think that your danger lies in a too slender\napplication of reason to the problem before you. It lurks, if anywhere,\nin a too great disregard of what is often supposed to be its\nantithesis. And I should like you to have written to me, not only that\nyou were 'naturally pleased, of course, if a little perplexed,' but that\nyou were _thrilled_. To which, no doubt, you will reply that in the\nfirst place you're not the sort of young woman that indulges in thrills,\nand in the second that, had you done so, you would certainly never have\ncommitted the fact to paper. But I should have read it between the\nlines. Ah, Molly, don't ever be _too_ afraid of thrills. For at the\nworst (the most _bourgeois_) they are at any rate evidences of life, not\nonly within but without--some all-pervading force, short-circuited for a\nmoment through your own awakened consciousness to that old, old world on\nwhich you stand; while at the best--well, who shall say from what unseen\nVessel the current has its birth? Could I find a place to be alone with heaven,\n I would speak my heart out; heaven is my need. Was it like that with you, Molly? Because that is how I would have it\nfor you, my dear. And I think it is worth waiting for, not for a week\nonly, as you have suggested to Arthur, but for far longer than that. You\nwill tell me, very likely, and with perfect truth, to remember that\nwherever marriages may be said to have their hypothetical origin, in\nactual practice they must needs evolve upon earth. And that's a side of\nthe question, no doubt, that a good many people are inclined to forget. But you're not one of them. And I should like you to give Heaven a\nchance, not only for your own sake, but for your future husband's,\nwhoever he may ultimately be. Husbands need a little halo, you see, at\nany rate to begin with. And that's why I should like you to wait\nawhile--say six months or so--even at the risk of causing young Lynn a\nlittle gentle (but quite harmless) unhappiness. And when--and if--he\ncomes to you then (for you mustn't allow him to promise) let your heart\nhave no doubt in its yes. Your affect. father,\n P. H.",

MY DEAR AUNT JOSEPHINE,\n\nIt is certainly very wrong of Claire not to have written to thank you\nfor the mittens. As you say, colds in the head are quite common in the\nmonths of May and June, and I have no doubt that if she wears them, as\nyou suggest, whenever she goes out to play, they will keep her hands\nvery warm indeed. I hope that you will hear from her in a day or two. With regard to the vicar's boy, I think, from what I remember of him,\nthat you can quite safely leave him in the hands of the vicar's very\nwise housekeeper and your own excellent doctor. I doubt too if he would\never really constantly wear the flannel cholera-belt that you have been\nmaking for him; and in any case, I think a temporary abstinence from\nbutter-scotch would be an even more effective measure. Your doctor is\nquite right about the tomatoes. There is no evidence to show that they\ncause cancer. But of course one must always be careful not to eat too\nmany of them. No, the gravel from which, I am sorry to hear, the new\nlay-reader suffers has nothing to do with that which is found in\ngardens. And it is quite sufficient, as you say, to account for a little\noccasional hastiness in his temper. We are all glad to hear that you\nhave been so busy and comparatively well, and both Esther and Molly join\nme in sending you their best love. Your affect. nephew,\n PETER HARDING.",

    "text": "XVI\n\n_To Lady Wroxton, The Manor House, Stoke Magna, Oxon._\n\n 91B HARLEY STREET, W.,\n _May_ 23, 1910. MY DEAR LADY WROXTON,\n\nI was very glad, as were we all, to hear from you again after so long a\nsilence, and gladder still to learn that the pleasant peacefulness of\nStoke is doing its good work on your behalf so surely, if still a little\nslowly. For both from your own letter and that of Dr. Rochester I can\nsee that the spirit of you is climbing back again towards the light,\nless lonely than you would have thought possible six months ago, and\ninto an air as clear even as that which you and your husband breathed\ntogether before he was taken from you. I think that I know how hard must\nbe the ascent, although in my own perhaps too peaceful life I have had\nlittle enough experience of these swift and terrible bereavements, that\nwill come to me also, I must suppose, in their due time. And it is only\nfrom the share, sometimes completely professional, sometimes rather\nmore intimate than this, that I have been called upon to take in such\nexperiences of others that I seem to have learned a very little about\nthe tides of grief. Looking down upon the dead face, touching the cold hand, lifting up the\nleaden arm, one cannot help feeling how utterly dead a dead man looks,\nan impression enormously deepened, as a rule, by the circumstances of\nthe last days. For in these his external, his spiritual activities have\nbeen, of necessity almost, set aside, and perhaps temporarily forgotten\nin the paramount appeals of his body itself. Now this organ, now that,\nmust be attended to, supported, cleansed, stimulated, implored, as it\nwere, to fulfil its duty towards the struggling economy of the whole. And as an almost inevitable result their slender responses, their final\nrefusals, have obsessed both patient and friends to the exclusion of\neverything else. The bodily case, so long taken for granted, and now so\nfast giving way, has become no longer a subordinate, but the predominant\nfactor in its owner's entity. So that when the body, _Imperator et Dux_\nof these later hours, at length lays down its sceptre, it's a small\nwonder if all else has appeared to die with it. Nor for a time can the\nformul\u00e6 of the churches seem anything but unreal, however humbly a\nschooled faith may try to accept their verity. The dead thing beneath\nthe sheet seems to weigh down the balance with a fact too stark for\ndisputation. Of the earth earthy, it is committed to the earth,\nresolving presently into its elements--and who shall tell its number any\nmore? Between mere friends, the friend taken and the friend left, this bodily\ndissolution has perhaps a less grim significance, or makes, at any rate,\na smaller demand on faith. We loved our friend for his ways, his wit,\nhis kindliness, his character, and not very particularly for his cast of\nfeature or mould of physique. But where friendship has allied itself\nwith passion, where the actual flesh has meant much, where souls have\nspoken, not only in sight and speech, but in touch and fast embrace, the\ndeath of the flesh must necessarily seem to involve so infinitely\nmore--enough almost to justify medi\u00e6val thought in demanding, for its\nconsolation, a belief in the resurrection of the body. And as a result\nthe well-meant advice of physicians and friends must appear at these\ntimes to be entirely inadequate--I was almost going to say\nimpertinent--because it must necessarily be only half informed. And yet I am not sure that we, standing at a distance (and perhaps even\nbecause of this), have not, after all, the real comfort in our hands. To\nyou, from whose close touch the alabaster box has slipped, its breaking\nhas seemed to mean the end of all things. You were so near to it. And\nhow irreparable was its fracture no eyes but yours could tell. So what\ncan we others say to you that can be of any value in your sorrow? Well, we can at least say this--that its perfume is still upon the air,\nits real gift to us and our great and permanent possession. It may be\neasier for us--his mere friends--to declare thus that we haven't really\nlost him. But given a little time it will become possible even to you,\nwho were heart of his heart. And if there's no older--and perhaps\ncolder--truism than this, yet it has a very sound and, I believe, an\nactually physical basis. For if we grant, as we needs must, that the\nmaterial body is ever changing, cell replacing cell by a continuous\nprocess of wasting and repair, so that the substance containing us\nto-day is by no means identical with that which contained us, as it\nwere, yesterday, why then the cells that called out for the physical\nsight and touch of those other cells that surrounded him we loved must\nnecessarily pass also upon their journey, and with them, to a very great\nextent, their anguish of unsatisfied desire. This is why, I think,\nnothing becomes more absolutely obliterated than a dead passion that has\nbeen merely bodily; and why also, in most other cases where passion has\nbeen a factor, the diminution of grief must be regarded as a completely\nnatural process and one that implies no shadow of disloyalty. It merely\nmeans that the sense of loss has been transferred to another and more\nspiritual plane, where, lo! it even appears at times to have been\nscarcely a loss at all; but instead a withdrawal, so obviously transient\nas to be itself an evidence of some certain, if incomprehensible\nreunion. With his memories so thronging, with the visible and abiding\nevidences of his activities so implicit in the growth of his successors,\nhow little, after all, has become the value of the vessel that contained\nhim!",

And there's no place like the\ncountry and some quiet garden therein in which to declare your war of\nindependence. For, as I told you before, sleeplessness _per se_ has never killed\nanybody yet; and where nothing but the rising and setting of stars, and\nthe opening and closing of flowers need call for your attention, you can\nvery comfortably afford to snap your fingers at it in defiance. But in\ntown it would be different. Your days would become, in spite of\nyourself, so automatically exacting that you would of necessity demand\nrespite from your nights--the very demand that, just at present, you\nmustn't be obliged to make. At Stoke, on the other hand, it doesn't\nmatter (and the more you insist on this the better), it doesn't matter a\nbit where, when, or how much, you sleep. The very air of the place is a\nfar too bewitching, and incidentally a quite adequate, substitute;\nwhile for dreams you have the whole cycle of field and garden husbandry\nspread out before your eyes, as little changing as the downs themselves,\nand like them pretty nearly \"half as old as time.\" So watch it for a\nyear, day in and day out, and leave the turmoils and telephones of\nLondon to such unfortunate and envious friends as P. H., of medicinal\nmemory. As regards the girl you sent up to me from the village last Friday, I\nhave taken her into one of my wards at the Hospital, where I fancy a\nlittle careful dieting will soon set her right again. At the same time I\nmay take the opportunity of examining the defaulting organ by means of a\nvery ingenious instrument just devised by two of my junior colleagues. It's a toy--it's going to be much more than that--that would have\ndelighted your husband's heart, and by its means, down a bent tube,\ninserted through her mouth, fitted with a tiny electric lamp and\nreflectors at the angles, I shall be able not only to peep into her\nstomach, but to survey it as thoroughly and particularly as I am now\nable to inspect her tongue. Even so do the youngsters show us the way! Yes, you are quite right. An\u00e6mia, dyspepsia, gastric ulcer seem to be\nthe special afflictions of the under-housemaid. And it's the damnable\nhabit of providing her with \"kitchen\" tea, and \"kitchen\" butter, and\n\"kitchen\" food of all sorts that is largely responsible for this, not\nonly directly, but indirectly, in that it tempts her to indulge in\nvarious kinds of unhealthy in-between meals. Surely the servants who\nwork for us, and feed us, and keep us clean, should be at least as well\nand as carefully fed as ourselves, even if they wouldn't be quite happy,\nperhaps, to sit at our own tables. And the careless (and I'm afraid\ndoubtful) ladies who think otherwise should be made to undergo a spell\nof domestic dieting in their own establishments. Esther and Molly, who are at home, join me in sending you their very\nbest love and hopes for a near-at-hand complete recovery; and, if you\ncan really put up with them, nothing will make Tom and Claire happier\nthan to spend a week or two of their summer holidays at Stoke. Your sincere friend,\n PETER HARDING. P.S.--You must try to forgive me for this rambling and rather\ninconsequent letter, but I have been both inflicting and enduring, for\nthe last ten days, a superfluity of full-dress lectures. So I have been\nwriting to you, as a result, in my mental shirtsleeves.",

    "text": "XVII\n\n_To Miss Sarah Harding, The Orphanage, Little Blessington, Dorset._\n\n HOTEL MODERNE, LOURDES,\n _June_ 7, 1910. MY DEAR SALLY,\n\nI have just encountered one of those strange half-accidents that crop up\nlike rocks in the quiet stream of one's everyday life just where a rock\nis the least likely to be. You turn the bend from Tuesday into\nWednesday, and hey presto, before you know what's happened, your little\ncanoe has been shot out of the main current into some unsuspected\nchannel, whence it emerges presently as from a waking dream. Last week as I went into the club between an afternoon at the hospital\nand two evening visits in Kensington, I met Bettany, of whom you may\nperhaps have heard me speak. A quite successful Government official, he\ncontrives also to edit one of the leading Roman Catholic newspapers and\nincidentally to organise with conspicuous ability periodical pilgrimages\nto various Continental shrines. He is a man who has always interested\nme, partly because he has seemed to me to possess in a very marked\ndegree one of the strongest and most challenging characteristics of his\nChurch--the habit, even in matters of religion, of completely\ndissociating the man from his function. A ladder for the faith of other\npeople need not necessarily have any faith of its own--and be an\nextremely serviceable ladder for all that. In his particular case, a\nbelief in the miraculous powers of those relics and waters to which he\nenables the faithful so comfortably to travel, is not, I think, _de\nfide_--demanded by his Church. In any case he does not possess it, but\nregards the whole phenomenon through his gold-rimmed spectacles with an\nentirely amiable, and of course very discreet, scepticism. At the same\ntime his talent for organisation and his unique knowledge of Continental\nhotels and railways are entirely at the disposal of his more credulous\nbrethren. And his name must be known in this connection to many\nthousands of Catholics on both sides of the Channel. On this particular evening he told me that he was extremely busy making\nthe final arrangements for what promised to be the largest English\npilgrimage that has yet travelled to Lourdes. And then, remembering\nsuddenly, I suppose, that I was a doctor of medicine, he sat bolt\nupright and said, \"By George, you're the very man that can help me.\" For\nit seemed that there were so many invalids going out with the party--at\nleast forty, he told me--some of whom were in a very bad way, that it\nhad appeared desirable to take a medical man in case of emergencies upon\nthe long journey. And did I know of anyone who would care to go? He had\nalready made some inquiries, he said, among Catholic medical friends,\nbut hadn't as yet found anyone who had been able to undertake the\nduties. He was not in a position to offer anything more than travelling\nexpenses; and he was beginning, as a consequence, to feel rather\ndoubtful about finding a man in time. It was not essential, he\nconsidered, that the accompanying physician should be himself a\nCatholic, provided that he was reasonably sympathetic; and then, reading\nmy thoughts, I suppose, he asked me if I should be sufficiently\ninterested to make the little trip myself. Well at first, of course, this seemed quite out of the question; but on\nlooking through my engagements I began to think that with a certain\namount of arrangement it might become possible after all. We were to\nleave Charing Cross at ten o'clock on Friday morning, and would be home\nby the following Thursday night. And it was to be quite understood that\nI was coming not as an official, but only as a visitor who would be\nwilling, if necessary, to render aid _en route_--all of which goes to\naccount for the address upon my notepaper, and the fact that I seem at\nthis moment to be very much more than eight hundred miles from Harley\nStreet. Joining the train at Charing Cross, it was quite obvious to me that a\nvery considerable proportion of the party was Irish--the sing-song\nwestern accent was everywhere--and that a comparatively large number of\npriests would be travelling with us. Most of these I have since\ndiscovered to be genial, even hilarious, souls, drawn, as it appears,\nfrom every stratum of society, and differing, as a consequence, very\ngreatly both in real education and superficial polish. It was not until we got on board at Folkestone that I had a first\nopportunity of becoming acquainted with the sick people of the assembly;\nand by this time I was already conscious of being surrounded by some\ncurious, indefinable atmosphere, that was walling us away from what to\nme, with my half-Protestant, half-scientific upbringing, represented\nthe everyday world. I doubt if many of my fellow-pilgrims felt this. But\nI am certain that the other passengers on the boat did. And it was both\nodd and a trifle amusing to observe the blank expressions upon numerous\nwell-fed and monocled countenances on their way to a normal Paris. Yet\nfrom my own point of view I had to admit that there was a good deal of\nexcuse for them. For we might all, as it seemed to me, very easily have\nstepped out of the Middle Ages. Of the more obvious invalids there were none, as far as I could see, who\nstood the smallest chance of benefiting, in a material sense, from their\nvisit to Lourdes. There were two blind girls, both cases of congenital\norganic disease--and who both chanced, by the way, to be among the very\nfew sufferers from sea-sickness. There was a little boy from a Sussex\nvillage, a case of infantile paralysis, brought by his mother in the\nfervent hope, as she told me, that Our Lady would use him as a means to\nconvert an extremely Nonconformist community.",

There was a little boy from a Sussex\nvillage, a case of infantile paralysis, brought by his mother in the\nfervent hope, as she told me, that Our Lady would use him as a means to\nconvert an extremely Nonconformist community. There was an older girl,\nsimilarly affected; and an elderly man, travelling quite alone, in\nalmost the last stages of cancer of the throat. With this poor fellow,\nwho was almost too weak to stand unaided, I had a long and very\npathetic conversation. He knew himself to be past all human aid, and was\njourneying from his home on the east coast to the shrine upon the Gave\nas to his last anchorage upon life. And I doubt, even so, if he had any\nreal belief in its efficacy for himself. But his journey, a really\nenormous effort for a man in his condition, would at any rate show that\nhe had had courage enough to make the trial. His is the only case that\nhas given me cause for any immediate anxiety, and were it not for his\nextraordinary pluck and will-power I should be more than doubtful about\ngetting him home alive. Of the other invalids, none were sufficiently apparent to disclose\nthemselves to me in a cursory tour round the ship with Bettany; and\nafter making the poor cancer patient as cosy as possible in the special\ntrain that was waiting for us at Boulogne, I repaired to the very\ncomfortable carriage reserved for us, and shared an excellent lunch with\nBettany, his lady secretary, and another member of the committee. The\njourney to Paris was uneventful, and after manoeuvring round its\nsouthern suburbs, we found ourselves about seven o'clock in the Gare\nd'Orl\u00e9ans, where a portion of the refreshment-room had been reserved for\nour dinner. During this meal I was introduced by Bettany to the Bishop\nwho is leading the pilgrimage--one of those rare men of whose essential\nsaintliness one becomes instantly aware, yet a man, too, of abundant\nstrength, and one, as I have since found out, capable of ensuring, with\nthe profoundest personal humility, the utmost tribute of respect to the\nhigh office that he represents. I suppose every Church contains such\nmen. It is at any rate pleasant to think so. But not all are wise enough\nto make them bishops--and missionary bishops at that. The same train left Paris with us about nine o'clock on the long journey\nto Lourdes; and after some desultory conversation we made ourselves\ncomfortable for the night. Fortunately, since our train was not of the\ncorridor type, the sick persons seemed to settle down pretty easily, and\nthe chief impressions that remain to me of the journey are a peep into a\ncool and cloudless sunrise over some vineyards between Poitiers and\nAngoul\u00eame and a very satisfactory _caf\u00e9 complet_ at Bordeaux. Two or\nthree times during the morning, both before and after reaching this\nplace, we were jeered at by onlookers at various wayside stations, who\nhad read the inscription _P\u00e8lerinage_ upon our carriage; and one or two\nof these had even gone so far as to throw stones. They were reminders,\nI suppose, that here in Lourdes seem almost incredible, of the enormous\nextent to which the anti-clerical movement has permeated elsewhere in\nFrance. The latter part of our journey, climbing slowly into the\nPyrenees, was enlivened for us by the presence of the Bishop, who had\ngiven up his own carriage to some indignant Irish pilgrims that had been\nso unfortunate as to have spent a sleepless night. Haymaking was already\nin full swing in these steaming valleys, with men and boys and\nbare-legged, brown-faced women all backs down over what seems to be a\nvery plentiful crop. * * * * *\n\nI have just here been tapped on the shoulder by an immaculately\napparelled American Catholic, who has just joined the pilgrimage from\nFlorence. He had learned, he told me, that I was a physician willing to\noblige. He suffered a little from gout, he said, and then proceeded to\npose me with the rather difficult question as to how often he ought to\ntake the waters. I explained to him that, as far as I knew, these have none but an\nethical value--a reply that obviously puzzled him. \"You mean,\" he inquired at last, \"that it's ENtirely a matter of faith?\"\n\n\"Precisely,\" I answered, and his brow cleared a little. \"Do you think I might have a Seidlitz powder to go on with?\" he asked. * * * * *\n\nWe arrived at Lourdes at about four o'clock on Saturday afternoon, after\njust thirty hours' travelling, and landed into a seething tumult of\ndeparting pilgrims, bullock-wagons, carriages, and electric trams. Losing sight of Bettany, I found myself looking vaguely round for some\nkind of conveyance, in company with the Bishop and his chaplain; and\nbetween us we managed to secure also a seat for our poor\nfellow-traveller from Essex, for whom we afterwards discovered a\nmoderately quiet bedroom in our hotel.",

After tea, the Bishop asked me to accompany him in a stroll round the\ntown and shrine, during which I learned a little about Lourdes, and a\ngood deal about my companion. Half-way between the plains and the higher\nranges of the Pyrenees, Lourdes itself lies in a valley, bisected by the\nGave, a tumbling mountain stream that supplies the holy water to the\ngrotto and the _piscines_, or invalid baths. The town itself, with its\nnarrow, winding streets, strung, as it were, between the\nfourteenth-century ch\u00e2teau on the one side and the nineteenth-century\nchurch that surmounts the shrine, on the other, is quite the most\nremarkable combination of medi\u00e6valism and modernity that I have seen;\nwhile its crowded, ever-changing population must be, I suppose, the\nsaddest, oddest, and perhaps the most unique in both the hemispheres. As\nwe walked down towards the shrine, we met returning most of those who\nhad gathered round the great square for the daily blessing of the sick;\nand passing through them we must have heard, I should think, almost\nevery dialect of Europe, Flemish perhaps predominant, since this was the\nlast day of a great Belgian pilgrimage, but German, Italian, English,\nSpanish, and of course French, at nearly every step. Every now and again, too, some ardent man or woman, seeing the big\namethyst ring on my friend's finger, would kneel down to kiss it and\nreceive his blessing, caring nothing for his difference of language and\nnationality, and everything for his holy office in their common church. Once or twice he smiled gently when they had gone their fervent way,\nclasping their votive candles or little bottles of sacred mountain\nwater, and once I ventured to press him a trifle as to his personal\nfaith in the Lourdes miracles. But he was a statesman, as I discovered,\nno less than a saint, and would confess to no more than a belief that\nthese dear people obtained perhaps a score of spiritual to each merely\ntemporal favour. And surely these were after all the better? The actual grotto, where fifty-two years ago the little Bernadette saw\nher visions of the Blessed Mary, lies now about a hundred yards from the\nriver's edge, along which a palisaded embankment has been built, that is\napt however, after sudden storms, to be pretty often under water. It is\nreally a cave set in a large rock around which, one above the other,\nhave since been built three churches, the topmost, with its tall and\nslender spire, being perhaps the most prominent landmark for a good many\nmiles around. With its walls polished by the elbows and fingers of\ncountless thousands of pilgrims, this little cavern contains an altar\nbefore which, in the open air, are ranged several rows of seats for\nworshippers at the shrine, and where, as I afterwards learned from a\ndisappointed Irish priest, it is considered a very special privilege to\nsay Mass. Next to the grotto are the baths, where the sick are immersed, and from\nwhich bottles of the holy water can be carried away to all parts of the\nworld; and to the left and above this is the great church, the lowest\nand largest of the three that now surmount the rock. The entrance to\nthis church stands upon a broad terrace above the immense open\namphitheatre, about which, in a circle some half a mile in\ncircumference, gather the sick people and their helpers and relations\nfor the afternoon passing of the Host. It is at this ceremony that the\nmajority of the miracles take place, of which, I suppose, the crutches,\nsplints, spinal jackets, and other surgical appliances that hang rusting\namong the wild geraniums over the entrance to the grotto are to be taken\nas partial evidences. There were still some poor sufferers waiting outside the _piscines_, and\na few others praying before the grotto; and pausing for a moment to\nwatch them and the various passers-by, one could not help being very\nforcibly struck with the all-pervading atmosphere of pity. Sights that\nelsewhere would have been veiled from the daylight are here frankly\nexposed, not to a kind of shuddering, if sympathetic horror, but as\npitiful, broken flowers to be gathered up, and laid with prayers upon\nthe altar of mercy. We concluded our little tour with a visit to the\nBureau des Contestations, the offices where the doctors attached to the\ngrotto--one of them an Englishman--receive and classify the histories of\nthe cures, examine the alleged _miracul\u00e9s_, deprecating the excited\nallegations of some, postponing their verdicts upon others, and\nrecording what seem to them, among a host of claims, to be genuine cases\nof Divine interposition.",

Both the doctors present when we arrived, and\nto whom Bettany, who had joined us, now introduced me, were extremely\ncourteous and only too anxious to lay before me all the material at\ntheir command. Both, as I could see at once, were men accustomed to deal\nwith human nature of the type and under the conditions that Lourdes\npresents, and it was therefore with very great diffidence that I found\nmyself even mentally criticising their results. Nevertheless it is true,\nI think, that nothing approaching to ordinary, exact scientific\nobservation, as the modern medical world understands it, is carried out\nat Lourdes; I doubt indeed if it would be possible; and I saw no\ninstance, either then or later, of a Lourdes cure that could not be\nexplained upon the observed and established lines of mental suggestion,\nor, apart from this, could bear a thorough cross-examination. Needless\nto say, the two doctors, both ardent and devout Roman Catholics,\nentirely disagreed with me, and assured me that after twenty years at\nthe shrine they were only the more convinced of Our Lady's bless\u00e9d and\nmaterial favours. And perhaps, after all, it is merely a question of\nterminology. But it is not until one has actually seen the procession of the Host at\nthe afternoon service in the amphitheatre that one has penetrated, as it\nwere, into the very heart of Lourdes. And so it was not, perhaps, until\nthree o'clock on the next afternoon that I found myself laid under the\nfull power of the strange, half-intoxicating, half-repellent spell of\nthis almost passionately fervent and yet at the same time strangely\ncommercial factory of miracles. All the morning, ever since the very\nearly hours, special trains had been rolling into the station, carrying,\nas we learned at breakfast, a pilgrimage, ten thousand strong, from the\ntowns and villages of Toulouse. At every turn we met them, groups of\nswarthy, and for the most part stunted, men and women, with sombre,\ntoil-worn faces, yet lit, in the majority of cases, with a deep-burning\nand almost apostolic faith. Gathered about their parish priests, buying\nrosaries and trinkets, little images of Bernadette Soubirous (sold by\nher numerous relatives, most of whom have already, in one way and\nanother, made considerable fortunes out of her vision), they filled the\nnarrow streets to overflowing, ardent, undoubting, agog for the least\nwhisper of some strange and fortunate miracle. And needless to say such\nwhispers were plentiful enough. Just before noon, for instance, an\napple-faced sister, collecting money from the more prosperous visitors\nat such hotels as ours for the free hostelries that are open elsewhere\nto the poor, told us with beaming smiles of a poor girl, with a large\nulcer upon her arm that had resisted all treatment for years. Last night\nshe had dipped it into the waters, and lo, this morning the disease had\nutterly vanished, and her skin was as the skin of a little child! There\nis a young priest here, a fine, upstanding fellow, who is a qualified\ndoctor, and has been a house-surgeon at one of our London hospitals. He\nis trying hard, I can see, to square his scientific prejudices, as he\nwould call them, with his religious desire to believe in these miracles. And at this he turned to me with something of triumph. \"If we could only find her out now,\" he said, \"how would you account for\nthat?\"\n\nBut on closer inquiry we discovered, alas, that the sister had not\nherself seen the ulcer before the cure was wrought; and later on in the\nday the doctors at the bureau assured me that no reports of such an\nincident had reached them. And we never succeeded in finding the girl,\nalthough the rumour of her cure had already spread like wildfire, and\nwill soon, no doubt, be reported as a definite miracle in cottages a\nthousand miles from here. In such an atmosphere then, and under a cloudless, burning sky, we\ngathered in the afternoon, some fourteen thousand strong, in a vast\ncircle before the steps of the grotto church. Quite early the\n_brancardiers_, a self-appointed order of workers, who assist in\ntransporting the sick, had been busy bringing their charges to the great\nsquare; so that the innermost row of the waiting host was already\nentirely composed of sufferers praying to be healed. Marching up and\ndown before them, clad in their robes of office, were the various\npriests who had come with them, telling their beads, and invoking the\nmultitudes to prayer.",

Marching up and\ndown before them, clad in their robes of office, were the various\npriests who had come with them, telling their beads, and invoking the\nmultitudes to prayer. As doctor to our own little party, Bettany enabled\nme to step within the ring, and walking with him, before the service, I\nmade a slow round of the circle, beholding such a clinic as could be\nseen, I suppose, nowhere else in the world--the clinic of Our Lady of\nLourdes, and one that seemed to me to contain, on this particular\nafternoon, pretty nearly every malady under the sun. \"Seigneur, Seigneur, ayez piti\u00e9 de moi.\" \"Mein Herr und mein Gott.\"\n\"Lord save us, or we perish.\" \"Hail, Mary, blessed among women.\"\n\"Seigneur, Seigneur, ayez piti\u00e9 de moi.\" In every tongue, as we walked\nround, the age-old cries for mercy rang in our ears, from a faith that\nit was impossible to doubt, and from a depth of human need that here, at\nany rate, nothing short of the Divine might satisfy. Presently, just as we had made our way back to our own little party, of\nwhom many, hitherto unsuspected, had now, by kneeling in the front row,\ntacitly declared themselves to be in need of physical healing, a new and\nsolemn sound began to break upon our ears--the sonorous chanting of\nmen's voices on the way up from the grotto in a long and slow\nprocession. \"Ave, Ave, Ave Maria,\" marching four abreast they now came\ninto sight, bearing lighted candles in their hands, and in an apparently\nendless succession, to turn presently into the great empty space about\nwhich the rest of us were gathered. Up the centre of this they now\nmarched, all the able-bodied men of the Toulouse pilgrimage, accompanied\nby many of their priests, singing the Lourdes hymn, and massing\nthemselves at last upon the broad terrace before the grotto church. Some\ntwenty minutes it must have taken for them thus to file past us; and\nfinally, under a canopy borne by four stalwart attendants, came the\nofficiating priest, clad in his heavy and gorgeous robes, and bearing\nbefore him the golden, flame-shaped monstrance in whose centre rested,\nas all this expectant gathering believed, the actual and visible body of\nthe Christ Himself. As they passed us I could see that the arduous task,\nunder this thrilling June sun, of thus holding up his Saviour to each of\nthese thousand sufferers had fallen to our own Bishop--the highest\ndignitary of the Church, I suppose, who happens just now to be in\nLourdes. As he moved slowly up the centre of the hot amphitheatre the\ncries of the poor _malades_ and their friends redoubled themselves in\nardour. \"Seigneur, Seigneur, ayez piti\u00e9 de moi.\" The tides of adoration\nrose and fell and rose again until, as step by step he passed along the\ncircle, they climbed up to a crest of almost agonising entreaty. \"Lord,\nsave us. Lord, save us, or we perish.\" To left and right we could hear\nthe broken voices sobbing their prayers to God, and even among our more\nstolid English sufferers could see the tears running down the uplifted\nworshipping faces. Watching the Bishop, as at last, after perhaps half\nan hour, his laboured progress brought him opposite to ourselves, I\ncould not help feeling how great must be the burden now bearing upon his\nshoulders, since apart from the actual physical strain, the continual\nstooping, in his thick robes and with his heavy monstrance, over patient\nafter patient in this thunderous heat, the emotional tax must have been\nenormous. For upon him and That which he bore there impinged now the\nwhole sum of these heart-wrung supplications. Upon his vicarious\nshoulders he must carry, as it were, the multitudinous petitions of all\nthese kneeling thousands. And yet it was just this, as afterwards, in\nthe cool of the hotel, he assured me, that was his chief support. Upborne by all this simple and unshakable belief, it was only then that\nhe was beginning to feel the bodily weariness that the long procession\nhad entailed upon him. So step by step he passed upon his way, until,\nmore than an hour later, the long round had been at last completed. And\nit was then, in a momentary silence that followed the conclusion of his\npassage, that from the far end of the circle a little cry arose, and a\nwoman, bedridden, as we afterwards learned, for more than fourteen\nyears, rose up from her chair, and tottered out into the space before\nher. Instantly the cry was everywhere abroad, \"A miracle, a miracle\";\nand like a leaf on the wind of ten thousand shoulders, she was being\nborne in an ecstasy of triumph towards the Bureau des Constatations. It was here, an hour later, that I saw her, a gentle-faced, devout\nlittle peasant woman, about whose past history the evidence seemed\nfairly conclusive. Smiling at us, she took a few steps across the room\namong the uplifted hands and eager exclamations of the assembled\npriests. But, alas, there would appear to be no physical reason why she\nshould not have walked thus at any time during her invalid years, if\nonly some stimulus, sufficiently effective, had been applied to her\nbefore.",

But, alas, there would appear to be no physical reason why she\nshould not have walked thus at any time during her invalid years, if\nonly some stimulus, sufficiently effective, had been applied to her\nbefore. Making my way slowly back to the hotel for tea, I was touched on the arm\nby a young French priest to whom I had spoken earlier in the day. He had\nbeen lamenting the great wave of godlessness that has seemed for the\nmoment to submerge the whole of France. But now his eyes were shining. \"Is it not wonderful,\" he cried, \"to see all this so great faith?\" He\nmoved his hands expressively. \"Ah, _la belle_ France, the heart of her\npeople is still hungry for its God--and some day--some day it will lift\nHim up again for all the world to see.\" And in the evening I saw him\nonce again at what was perhaps, after all, the great climax of the\nLourdes day. Sipping my coffee with Bettany at a small boulevard near the hotel, we\nhad already seen hundreds of little points of flame gathering out of the\ngrowing darkness towards the grotto and its churches. And this evening\nprocession of candle-bearing pilgrims marks perhaps the last word--if I\nmay quite reverently put it so--in the stage-management of Lourdes. For\nat a given signal not only do a thousand slender lamps pencil out in\ngold and red and blue the uplifted tapering spire and every arch and\npinnacle of the church upon the rock; but a couple of miles away, and\nthree thousand feet high on the crest of the Pic du Ger, a great cross,\nilluminated by a battery from the town, springs suddenly out into the\nsky. The outline of the hill itself, and behind it the snow-clad,\nretreating summits of the higher Pyrenees have long since been blotted\naway in the night; so that now this gleaming cross shines out among the\nstars, among which it might well be some new and glorious constellation. To many, indeed, among the more ignorant of the processionists it must\nin itself savour strongly of the miraculous; and in any case, swung\nthere in the southern sky, it lends a note, a little bizarre perhaps,\nand yet, in its way, extraordinarily impressive, to the general vision\nof Lourdes by night. Presently the long procession has formed itself, and now begins to move\nfrom the grotto out towards the big statue of the Virgin at the opposite\nend of the square (itself lit up with coloured fairy lamps) and thence,\na river of light in the soft June darkness, through the rocky defile,\nwhere are represented the seven stations of the Cross. And as it passes\nonwards the hymn once more swells up to us in a hundred keys and voices,\naltos and baritones and trebles, \"Ave, Ave, Ave Maria,\" robbed, by the\nvery depths of its sincerity, of any semblance of discord. For fully an\nhour we watched it--the solemn passing of these earnest, candle-lit\nfaces; and then, moving down the broad terrace above the square, we met\nagain the leaders of the procession as they drew up below the steps. Presently they had all gathered there, thousands strong; whereupon, led\nby a priest from the open door of the church, they recited in one voice\nthe great credo of their faith. Catholic or not, materialist, or\nveriest atheist, it would have been impossible, I think, to listen\nunmoved to the deep-chested volume of sound that now rose up before\nus--superstitious if you will, but with a superstition that had laid its\nfibres into humanity's deepest being. And perhaps, after all, it was\nthis strong, vibrating declaration of belief, purged, if not completely,\nyet to a very great extent, of such hysterical elements as had been\nobvious in the afternoon, that swept us up to the topmost pinnacle of\nthe day's experiences. In the eyes of my young priest, at any rate, I\ncould read that this was so. For him, as I could see, this was at once\nthe bugle-note of the undefeatable hosts of God, and the herald of the\ngreat kingdom that was to come. It was the day's last word to him; and\nit rang gloriously with victory. But for us there was another. For returning presently in a darkness that\nseemed doubly deep after the sudden extinguishing of all these lamps and\ncandles, we came by accident upon a lover and his sweetheart. His arm\nwas about her waist, and as we passed he was kissing her under the\nshadow of a doorway--a common enough spectacle, yet one that came upon\nus now with a shock that was almost startling. It served, at any rate,\nto demonstrate how far, in twenty-four hours, we had drifted from the\nnormal--and to remind me, with an odd and almost unbelievable emphasis,\nthat in less than three days' time I shall be walking through Kensington\nGardens. Yr. affect. brother,\n PETER.",

    "text": "XVIII\n\n_To Robert Lynn, M.R.C.S., Applebrook, Devon._\n\n 91B HARLEY STREET, W.,\n _June_ 25, 1910. MY DEAR BOB,\n\nI have had a talk with Arthur, as you suggested, about his new\nappointment, and I think, on the whole, that he would be well advised to\ntake it. As he said to me, poor boy, he has had just lately to readjust\nhis future a bit, and the practice that he had thought of buying has\nceased to have much attraction for him. And I needn't tell you again how\nvery sorry I am that Molly, and perhaps to a lesser degree both Esther\nand myself, have been responsible for this. For you know quite well that\nthere is nobody whom we would more gladly have welcomed as an extra son;\nand until quite lately we both fully believed--although we had never of\ncourse actually ascertained this--that Molly returned his feelings. Alas, however, for the best-laid plans--for since we discussed the\nmatter at Applebrook, I have become almost certain that although her\nanswer would be \"yes\" on every other ground but this, on this\nparticular one she will never, I'm afraid, be able to meet him with open\narms. The event may contradict me, but I think not. The divine spark has\nnot yet touched her heart. And I know you are with me in believing that\nshe would be wrong, with all her youth in front of her, not to wait for\nit a little longer. And so Arthur, being robbed (but only for a time, I\nhope) of what he tells me sorrowfully was his _raison d'\u00eatre_, has\ndecided to postpone his d\u00e9but as a general practitioner--yet not\nwithout, unless I am very greatly mistaken, a certain secret atom of\nrelief. For his real inclinations, I am sure, still centre in the\nlaboratory and the microscope; and it was chiefly for financial reasons\nthat he had abandoned any ideas of further dallying with them. He wanted\nto \"do Molly,\" as he confided to me, \"as well as he could\"; and that\nwould have been impossible, he was afraid, as a bacteriologist or\npathologist. And there, from a strictly monetary standpoint, he was\nperhaps in the right. For though, as a profession (and through us, the\ngreat public), we must needs lean each year more heavily upon these\nskilled workers at our right hand, yet at present we are all very\nreluctant to give them their full dues either in professional _\u00e9clat_\nor pounds, shillings, and pence. All the same, their day is coming, if\nperhaps a little slowly; so that maybe, after all, Miss Molly's\nunintentional cruelty may prove to be an angel in mufti. And now that he\nis in no immediate need of earning more money than can comfortably\nsupport himself, I think that this new appointment, as assistant in the\ninoculation department, is just the job for him. It will mean of course\ntwo years of life; but he has already been a house-surgeon and a\nhouse-physician, and in any case a two years' training in the exactest\nof all scientific technique will not be a waste of time whatever his\nultimate occupation is destined to be. Moreover (though it is seldom wise to prophesy) I am becoming pretty\nthoroughly convinced that the future of medicine lies more wholly in the\nhands of the vaccino-therapists than any of us are as yet quite able to\nrealise. For when one comes to think of it, although surgery, during the\nlast fifty years, has been advancing by leaps and bounds, medicine has\nbeen standing very still indeed. Where it has moved at all it has been\nchiefly on the lines of improving its methods of diagnosis, while as\nregards treatment it has remained very nearly as empirical as it was a\ncentury ago. Perhaps this is rather a hard saying, but in the main I am\nquite sure that it is a true one. And I think its restoration to lively\nand effective growth will be more dependent upon the methods, so sound\nin their conception and so brilliant in their performance, of Sir\nAlmroth Wright and his fellow-workers, at home and abroad, than upon any\nother factor now making for medical progress. As a school they are no\ndoubt destined to confront a good many reverses. And they will presently\nbe forced, I suspect, to re-state a certain number of their present\nbeliefs. But their guiding principle is so essentially sane, so really\nscientific, in the true sense of an abused adjective, that I cannot\nthink your boy will go far wrong in perfecting himself in their methods,\nand even perhaps deciding later to specialise altogether in this\nparticular branch of medicine. To determine by culture the precise organism that is causing a patient's\nmalady (and how few are the diseases left to us that may be definitely\nclassed as non-microbic); to learn by an examination of his blood-cells\nthe exact condition of his resisting powers; and to increase these by\ncarefully graduated doses of his own or similar bacteria until his newly\nstimulated anti-bodies have been so increased and fortified as to be\nable to win their own battle--it is a general method of treatment that\nseems to me to hold more palpably the key to future victory than any\nother. There's an infinity yet to be learned about it, of course. The\nmysteries of the anti-body have been scarcely fringed. And the technique\nis still so difficult that none but a highly trained man can be trusted\nwith it. But if anybody is to win an ultimate triumph over incidental\ndisease it is that trained man who is going to do it. And the sooner we\nconsulting physicians learn rather to count him as a brother than a mere\nlaboratory assistant, the better will it be for the march of light and\nhealing. Amen.",

This little peroration was put into my head by a passage\nin an address that I heard delivered the other day at an evening lecture\nto post-graduates. \"Gentlemen,\" said the lecturer--a well-known provincial consultant, \"I\nshould like the day to dawn when I could be met at the door of my\nhospital by a trained chemist, a trained bacteriologist, a trained\npathologist, so that when I came to some complicated case I could say,\n'Chemist, a part of this problem is yours, take it and work it out. Bacteriologist, perform your share in elucidating this difficulty. Pathologist, advance, and do likewise.'\"\n\nThere was a little applause; and after all, he had got, I suppose, some\nglimmering of what the new medicine is to be. Only he, the lecturer, was\nstill, do you see, to be the _deus ex machina_. He was a genial old\ngentleman and quite without conceit, and was merely taking, as we all\ndo, I'm afraid, the predominant position of the consulting physician as\nfixed for eternity. Whereas instead it is quite healthily rocking, I\nfancy, on waters that are ceasing to be stagnant. Yours ever,\n P. H.",

    "text": "XIX\n\n_To Hugh Pontrex, Hotel Montana, Biarritz._\n\n 91B HARLEY STREET, W.,\n _July_ 16, 1910. MY DEAR HUGH,\n\nSo the pendulum of our frailty swings. The warm airs of July have\nsurrounded you with well-being in your Atlantic quarters, and a\nconfounded carbuncle under my left shoulder has been painting my world\nquite black for at least four days, and grey for the inside of a week. It's the penalty, I suppose, of being rarely laid aside by sickness,\nthat when some trivial misfortune does make its appearance, one\nexaggerates its proportion in the general scheme of things to a quite\nunmerited degree--and especially, I think, if one happens to be a\ndoctor. \"Physician, heal thyself,\" the mockers say. But he should never\nattempt to. He knows too much about the various possibilities, the\nremoter significances of each one of his little troubles, to be a\nsufficiently clear-minded judge. And he is far better advised when he\nresigns his body _in toto_ to the care of some outside mind, and\nconfines his own mental powers to the fortification of his private\nphilosophy. Pain, sleeplessness, and that peculiar sense of being disowned by one's\nown body that a high temperature always seems to induce--I suppose if\nall the comfortable words that have been uttered in their explanation\nwere to be gathered up into a book the whole world would not be great\nenough to contain it. We were told not so desperately long ago that they\nrepresented the direct tenancy of the evil one or some of his\ndependents. Then a more enlightened but still stern theology informed us\nthat they represented the well-deserved judgments of God; until a later\nand more generous interpretation has inclined rather to believe in them\nas evidences, a little puzzlingly disguised, of a chastening yet still\nindubitable Love. But, alas, it is so easy, even in the full comfort of bodily health, to\nperceive the bottomless gaps in these and all other arguments about the\ngreat problem of pain, that in the actual enduring of it there seems,\nafter all, very little to be done but to lie low, and bear it humbly--as\nmany a better fellow and weaker woman have borne worse things before us\nsince the foreconsciousness of death became the price of the first\nman's soul. And yet I believe quite orthodoxly that these unattractive\nepisodes in one's life--even carbuncles--do really contain some sort of\na message to one's intelligence, apart from the patent one that\nsomewhere or other one has blundered against a natural law, and paid the\nnecessary penalty. For there comes a period in most illnesses, I think, sometimes during a\ntemporary respite, more often perhaps at the first dawn of\nconvalescence, when one becomes extraordinarily conscious, yet without\ndiscomfort, of the almost trivial delicacy of one's surrounding tissue. It is generally, I suppose, a moment of exhaustion, both mental and\nphysical, either upon the bugle of a victory or a truce. But it is a\nmoment when one's spiritual \u00e6sthesis, as it were, is peculiarly at\nliberty. Very soon, in a minute or two even, Nature will begin her work\nof restoration--none more willing than she, given a very little patience\nand half a straw to make her bricks with. But now she is standing by for\na moment, trowel in hand, and the outer wind is breathing through the\ngap. And it's then, I think, if you'll only listen carefully enough,\nthat you can sometimes hear it whispering. \"Presently,\" you can hear it say, \"this little house of yours will be\nmended, and the more easily maybe, because its walls are so thin. But\ndon't--don't forget too quickly that it is but a house after all.\"\n\nYet I suppose we do forget it, most of us, and probably quite healthily,\nwhen once the dwelling-place is bricked up again, and the new paint is\non, and it stands foursquare to the winds that may not enter now. And\nyet again, if the message has once been heard, or twice, or thrice, as\ncircumstances have it, I don't believe that it is ever entirely lost. And there, perhaps, may even lie the key to all the mystery; so that\nwhen the last storm blows, and Nature must shake her head, and let the\nfrail house fall, its tenant may not go out altogether unprepared. I felt all this very strongly some ten days ago, having made or reviewed\nmy will about twenty-seven times, resigned myself to the administration\nof gas and the skilful weapons of old Sir Jeremy across the way, and\nawakened next morning to a normal temperature and a comparatively\ncomfortable back. But a week's high feeding, and three days with Esther\nat Eastbourne, in the occasional brisk and simple company of Claire and\nher pals, have been steadily blunting my higher susceptibilities. So\nthat's why I've been setting them on record with so much circumstantial\ndetail--a great deal less for your satisfaction than my own. We had resolved to take Miss Claire by surprise, and, calling at the\nschool, found, as a consequence, that she was out. She had probably gone\nPevensey way, thought the maid, with some of the older young ladies and\none of the governesses. And it was out Pevensey way that we presently\nrecognised upon the beach, among a heterogeneous collection of empty\nshoes and stockings, some big-brimmed straw hats with the school ribbon\nupon them. Their owners were for the most part thigh-deep in the English\nChannel with their skirts tucked conveniently round their plump waists. And they were being watched from the shore by a very pleasant young\nlady, who looked rather wistfully as if she would like to be out there\ntoo. Yes, she told us, Claire was in the water with the others, probably\namong the deeper ones who were getting their knickers wet.",

Surveying the\nmel\u00e9e with an expression of polite concern, she was rather afraid that\nit would be a little difficult to make Claire understand who we were. But if we wouldn't mind waiting for a minute or two they would all be\ncoming in to dry their legs before going back to prep. Presently some floating atom of wreckage took them unanimously eastward,\nsplashing through the shallows, until the governess, waving a white\nhandkerchief, brought them gingerly ashore across a little bank of\nrather slippery-looking rock. There was a general shaking out and\nrearranging of tousled manes, yellow and chestnut and black, and a\nmodest dropping of skirts to the demurer level of shining wet knees. The little party drifted slowly towards us, their brown feet lingering\nwholesomely across the sands. \"You'll know Claire,\" said the governess, \"by the bandage round her\ninstep. I oughtn't really to have let her paddle.\"\n\nEsther's eyes became a little anxious. \"But what has been the matter?\" she asked. The governess smiled. \"Oh, nothing very serious,\" she said. \"And I think you must ask Claire\nherself. Tales out of school, you know.\"\n\nAnd then the least tidy, perhaps, of the damsels detached herself\nsuddenly from her comrades, and came down upon us at top speed,\nregardless of pebbles. \"Have you got me off prep?\" she asked earnestly, after she had kissed us\nand found her shoes and stockings. And having explained to her that we\nwere going to take her out to tea for a pre-birthday treat--she was\ngoing to be sixteen next week--we inquired about the bandage. It was the\nresult, we discovered, of an illegal (and unconfirmed) raid upon a\nneighbouring dormitory, during which, by a kind of Homeric retribution,\na stray tin-tack had wounded her unprotected foot. \"But it's about well now, I should think,\" she said, undoing the\nbandage, and turning up a salmon-pink sole for our inspection. And we\nwere obliged to confess that it was. She rolled up the bandage into a little ball, and threw it down the\nbeach. \"I wish we could _always_ go barefoot,\" she sighed. And for the moment I\nfelt inclined to agree with her. For the happy foot, as T. E. Brown has\nsaid, swings rather from the heart than from the hip. And there are few\nprettier things in nature than the restless, romping legs of the average\nhealthy little maiden. They are her life's joy made visible; so that it\nreally seems a shame, if a necessary one, to imprison them in even the\nairiest of stockings and the most hygienic of leather shoes. Blue gingham petticoats,\n White blown aprons,\n Five pairs of plump legs\n Twinkling down the hill,\n Black imprisoned plump legs,\n Fretful for the stream bed,\n Tired of shoes and stockings,\n Dancing like a rill,\n Dancing down the hillside,\n So come the children,\n Like a rill in sunshine,\n So dance they,\n Seek the solemn waters,\n Marching to the ocean,\n Set the solemn waters\n Laughing at their play. So into my heart come,\n Silver it with laughter,\n Lest among the shadows\n Lost should be its way,\n So into my heart come\n Rosamund and Daphne,\n Marian and Rosemary,\n And little baby May. Claire and her companions had been paddling in the big ocean itself; and\nbeing comparatively dignified did not of course wear aprons. Moreover,\nas I had the strongest reasons for believing, they were at this moment\nquite innocent of petticoats. But the little poem comes back to me as I\nwrite. \"And next week,\" she proceeded ruefully, \"I shall have to go into blobs\nand half-masters.\"\n\nWe stared at her rather blankly. \"All the girls do, you know,\" she added, \"when they turn sixteen.\"\n\n\"But blobs----\" I began. \"And half-masters?\" puzzled Esther. \"When your hair's neither up nor down,\" Claire explained, \"with a big\nfat bow on it. And when you have to wear skirts a foot below your\nknees.\"\n\nShe rolled over, and struck her toes into the sand. \"It's to show,\" she finished pathetically, \"that you're too grown up to\nbe spanked and not old enough to have visiting cards.\"\n\nWhich seems to suggest that even sixteen may have its tragedies, though\nits capacity for ices remains happily unimpaired. Or would you call them\ngrowing pains? And are all pains growing pains? Ever yrs.,\n P. H.",

    "text": "XX\n\n_To Horace Harding, c/o Major Alec Cameron, Glen Bruisk, Sutherland,\nN.B._\n\n 91B HARLEY STREET, W.,\n _August_ 17, 1910. MY DEAR HORACE,\n\nSo you have yielded at last. Your fine contempt for the gentlest art has\nbegun to dissolve. And being on the very brink of one of the snuggest of\nsea-trout lochs you think that you must really have a cast or two upon\nits waters. There are people who will tell you, of course, that it's a\nblind man's game, or very nearly so, this loch trout fishing. But let\nthe blue waters--crinkled, if fortune smiles, with the daintiest of\nripples--be their immediate and sufficient refutation. And some day they\nmay behold you casting one of Mrs. Richardson's artfullest duns over\nthose senior wranglers among trout that lurk in the disillusioned depths\nof the Itchen. At the same time I am not forwarding you an outfit for your birthday\npresent, as you so delicately suggest, firstly because you tell me that\nMajor Cameron can easily fix you up with all that is necessary; but\nprincipally because I am not quite comfortable in my mind as to your\nreal motive for caressing the surface of Loch Bruisk. I should like to\nbe just a little surer that it is a genuine regard for _salmo trutta_\nrather than a merely altruistic (though very praiseworthy) desire to be\nproperly companionable to Miss Graham, who is, as you tell me, so\nawfully keen about it. It is of course a very strong point in her favour, and I remember her\nbrother quite well. He plays half for Richmond, I think, and you\nintroduced us to one another at Queen's. And his sister--I don't\nremember that you have mentioned her to me before--may of course be the\nmeans to an end--an instrument chosen by a merciful Providence whereby a\nnew channel of enjoyment is about to be revealed to you. But on the\nother hand, I can't help feeling that with your duty done, cheerfully\nand bravely, as I have no doubt will be the case--and Miss Graham\naway--the yearning to catch trout may conceivably leave you. So I am\nsending you instead my very best wishes for the happiest of birthdays,\nand a hope that you have many others yet in store for you. I am glad that you have determined to go up for your second medical some\ntime next year, and note that you have taken away volumes of anatomy and\nphysiology in your trunk. If you will accept my paternal advice,\nhowever, you will leave them there until you have decided that your\nhealth is sufficiently recuperated to return either to Cambridge or\nHarley Street. I don't want you to curtail your holidays. I have far too\nmuch respect both for holidays in general and yourself in particular. For it's one of the most pathetic features about the genuine old codger\n(and one of his surest signs too) that his periods of recreation tend to\nbecome progressively shorter--and not always by force of circumstances. They may actually begin to bore him. He may even have to make an effort\nof will to prolong them for his ultimate good--to school himself into\nregarding them as cures. Thus, while at twenty-two a summer vacation of\nless than two months is too monstrous to be seriously considered, at\nforty-two one becomes grateful for a fortnight, could do with three\nweeks, but is apt to find a month just a trifle too long. Whereas at\nfifty-two---- So don't curtail them. And yet better is it to curtail\nthem than to pollute. And unless you particularly need them for\npreserving specimens of the local flora or maintaining the creases upon\nyour Sunday trousers, you should never, never, never pack technical\nbooks in a holiday trunk. It is to put poison--or at any rate\nwater--into the wine that you are to pour out before the gods of\nmountain and moor and loch. And though they are generous they are proud. And they will surely make you repent it--not merely because it is\ntactless, as though you should make Miss Dolly--I think that was her\nname?--the staple article of your conversations with Miss Graham; and\nnot merely because it shows your ignorance, as though you should munch\nginger-nuts with that fine old port which your uncle has dug up for your\nespecial benefit; but because--far worse--it is an evidence of\ndouble-dealing. And no god, not even the presiding deity of the tiniest\nmountain ash, is going to stand that. If you read your Bible, as I hope\nyou do, you will have been warned concerning this simultaneous worship\nof two contrary masters, and the doom that must certainly befall it. And\nthat's why no really wise schoolmaster ever sets his pupils a holiday\ntask, though there are still, I'm afraid, a few foolish ones left. I\nhardly like to think that mine can have been among them; and yet there's\nno doubt that \"Marmion,\" the \"Lady of the Lake,\" the \"Cloister and the\nHearth,\" and several other peaks upon the literary landscape remain\nclouded to me for ever. You would have thought this a sufficiently clear lesson, perhaps, upon\nthe point that I am pressing into you. But it wasn't. And I remember\nconsecrating a golden September in Fife to the mastery of my materia\nmedica. There's a moor, for instance, somewhere between Dunfermline and\nRumbling Bridge that will eternally be associated in my mind with the\npreparations of opium. I can recall in all its hideous detail some such\nafternoon's tramp as this:--\n\n\"By George, that's a fine piece of colouring, the sunlight on that dying\nheather over there, Tinct: Camph: Co: strength of opium one in two\nhundred and forty.

There are the Ochils again, pil: plumbi cum opio,\nstrength of opium one in eight---- Damn, I forgot to look for that big\ntrout when I crossed the burn just now. Extractum opii, strength of\nopium two in one\" (it sounds improbable--even theological--but if you\nlook it up you will discover it to be correct, and I have never found\nthe knowledge in the least important). And, as a result, that particular\nmoor will always whisper to me unhealthily of morphia, while the\npreparations of opium had to be learned all over again in something\nless than six weeks' time. And you will generally find it to be the case, I think, that the work\nwhich has desecrated the holiday can seldom stand either the test of an\nexamination or the more valuable one of practical appliance. For it's\nthe term's work, the good, solid, everyday's grind in the\ndissecting-room or the physiological theatre, and later in the wards and\nthe out-patient department, that is the bone and marrow of your\npre-graduate education. Without it no amount of feverish cramming will\never make you efficient, though it may occasionally perhaps save you\nfrom being deservedly ploughed. And with it no cramming should be\nnecessary--or at most a very little. For there are still a few subjects,\nalas, demanded by examining boards that can be learned, I suppose, in no\nother way--such as the preparations of opium before mentioned, with\ntheir respective strengths and all that appertains unto them, and the\ningredients of various obscure powders that you will never hear about\nagain. In after life you will always refer to your pharmacopeia if you\nwant information upon these subjects, and no normal mind has either the\ncapacity or the desire to retain their details for so long as\ntwenty-four hours after they have been required in the examination-room. But as a general rule, and one that is happily gaining ground every\nyear, you will find that your examiners will far prefer to discover in\nyou the evidences of a functionally active, if somewhat lightly stored,\nmind than a kind of _pat\u00e9 de foie gras_, fattened up for the occasion,\nbut too inert, as a result, to leave him quite happy about its future. And that's why it's always a good thing to take life easily during the\nlast week before your papers have to be written. Go abroad, mix with\nnormal men and women, to whom examinations are just episodes in the\nlives of other people, fearsome but remote. And remind yourself in their\nunruffled company that, after all, they _are_ merely episodes. You won't\nforget anything really important in that time. If you do, you can never\nproperly have known it. While as for the trimmings, you will be more\nthan compensated for the shedding of a few of these by the sanity and\nfreshness with which your brain will come to its ordeal--as an example\nof the reverse of which there occurs to me the vision of a pallid young\nman who addressed me about six weeks ago in the hospital lobby. He was\nvery much frightened. I didn't know who he was. Indeed I don't think\nthat I had ever seen him before. And the remnants of a natural modesty\nwere evidently struggling to hold him back. But Circumstance, and the\nawful fact that in less than an hour's time he was due for a _viva_ upon\nthe Thames Embankment, forced him trembling towards me. He wiped his\nforehead--I was the only likely subject within range at the moment, and\nhis train was to leave in exactly seven and a half minutes. \"I can remember the hooklets,\" he gasped, \"but _would_ you mind telling\nme, sir, which of the tapeworms it is that has four suckers?\"\n\nPoor boy--I could see that his whole future was pivoting miserably upon\nthose forgotten suckers; and, by an excessively fortunate accident, I\nhappened to have some notes for a lecture upon the subject in one of my\npockets. \"If you'll wait a moment,\" I told him honestly, \"I think that I can let\nyou know. But I really couldn't tell you offhand.\"\n\nHe looked at me anxiously, and I could see my reputation tottering in\nhis eyes as I searched about for my pocket-book. \"Nor could your examiners, you know,\" I assured him, \"unless they had\njust primed themselves beforehand, or carried notes upon their\ncuffs--which they probably do.\"\n\nHis brow cleared amazingly at this, and I could see that the relative\nimportance of knowing, without reference, the precise number of a\ntapeworm's suckers was beginning to define itself a little more clearly\nto his distressed understanding. So I read out my notes to him, and he\ndashed upon his way, relieved if not rejoicing. But you mustn't ever\nbecome like that, you know, although it's not so difficult to do so as\nyou may think. And lastly, if there should be a Miss Graham--I speak in the abstract,\nof course, and very, very tentatively--she must be allowed to share none\nof the homage that every respectable examination insists upon\nmonopolising.",

For though I am\nquite open to conviction about the fishing, I feel rather more certain\nabout the shooting. It was pre-Grahamite, you see--you haven't told me\nher Christian name--pre-Dollyite, pre-Berylite--and even, if I remember\nrightly, pre-Looite; so that I think it may safely be accepted as being\nintegral and not merely adventitious. Anyway, there's the gun, and I\nhope that you'll kill many grouse with it in spite of your sister Molly\nand her humanitarian comrades. For grouse, like men, must die on a day,\nand better the quick shot in mid-flight than to crawl away, and to\nperish slowly in the corner as most of us, alas, will probably have to\ndo when our sunset days come round. I expect you will already have had letters from mother and Molly, if not\nfrom Tom and Claire, who are staying with Lady Wroxton at Stoke, and\ndefying the Thames Conservancy in the matter of mixed bathing during\nmost of the forbidden hours. You heard, no doubt, or saw in the papers,\nthat Rupert Morris has had a K added to his C.B.; which means, I\nsuppose, that his little scrap on the frontier was more important than\nhe led us to suppose. In any case, nobody, I should think, has deserved\nhis title more, and quite certainly no one will value it less. He is\nexpected home, I believe, about the end of September, and you will\nprobably meet him at Stoke, where Molly (having squared her conscience)\nis presently to assist in the extra housekeeping demanded by the\npartridges and pheasants. With much love,\n\n Yr. affect. father,\n P. H.",

MY DEAR AUNT JOSEPHINE,\n\nI have, of course, frequently seen many of the pictures that you\nmention, and have also read some of the stories of which, as you say,\neach illustration professes to tell one. I don't think however that I\nhave seen the particular one of the signalman which you enclose; and it\ncertainly seems a coincidence that he should be pressing his left hand\nso vehemently upon the precise spot at which your cook also is so apt to\nsuffer pain. And it is odd too that, like her, he would appear to be so\nthoroughly respectable that their common affliction becomes a little\ndifficult to understand. It is not, as you say, as if either of them\ngave one the least impression of being in any degree _loose_ or\n_rackety_. At the same time, from a close examination of the signalman's\nanatomy, I don't think that the organs so frequently mentioned in his\nvery eloquent account of himself are those most likely to be affected. And perhaps your cook may also be happily under a similar\nmisapprehension. And that is why, before taking the pills that have been\nso markedly blessed to the signalman, I would suggest the outward\napplication of a little friction with the open palm of someone else's\nhand in which have been previously placed a few drops of turpentine. It\nwill be so far less expensive, you see; and, even if not finally\nsuccessful, will at any rate do no harm. But I have great hopes. Your affect. nephew,\n PETER HARDING.",

    "text": "XXII\n\n_To Reginald Pole, S.Y. Nautilus, Harwich._\n\n 91B HARLEY STREET, W.,\n _August_ 30, 1910. MY DEAR REGGIE,\n\nWhen one of your youngest journalists from Franciscan House called upon\nme last night, I guessed at once that you were either away from home or\nthat you had given the lad _carte blanche_ to collect material for a\n\"silly season\" discussion, without adding an Olympian hint or two as to\nwhere he had best go hunting. As a matter of fact both surmises turned\nout to be correct; and I even seemed to detect in him a certain air of\nrelief as he admitted the first, while he was still young enough to feel\nrather important with regard to the second. Unhappy youth--how should he\nknow that he had run into the very jaws of your arch-enemy? It was a college friendship with Horace, he informed me, that was his\nexcuse for calling upon me, although of course he knew quite well that I\nwas an eminent authority on the subject in hand. This was so obvious an\nafterthought that I couldn't help asking him what the subject might be. He told his lie so nicely, you see, and was so humbly aware of its small\nworth. He coloured a little. \"Are we nervous?\" he said. I pushed over the tobacco-jar, and asked him to fill his pipe. \"I hope not,\" I replied, and he coloured a little more. \"You don't understand,\" he explained. \"That is to be the headline of the\ndiscussion. At least, that was what I'd thought myself. But some of the\nother fellows have suggested, 'Are we _more_ nervous?' or 'Where are our\nNational Nerves?' or 'National Neurosis; are we suffering from it?'\"\n\nI nodded. \"Yours is the shortest,\" I said. \"Just so,\" he replied, \"and, I think, the most arresting.\"\n\n\"And who's going to write the first letter?\" I asked. \"Well,\" he stammered, \"I rather expect it will be me.\"\n\n\"And you'll call yourself 'A London Physician,' I suppose?\"\n\n\"Something like that,\" he confessed. \"You see, a newspaper discussion\nlike this is all right when once it's started--that is, if it's a live\none, as Mr. Pole calls it. The other letters simply pour in.\"\n\n\"From Balham and Holloway and Tottenham and Ilford----\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\" he smiled, \"and from Kensington and Mayfair as well.\"\n\n\"You think that a good many of your readers will like to tell the public\nall about their nerves?\"\n\n\"Thousands of 'em,\" he said confidently. \"And you'll select a certain number of letters from each district, and\nfill up a couple of your daily columns for nothing?\"\n\n\"That's the idea. And we shall give a lot of pleasure too.\"\n\n\"And the writers and the writers' friends will rush to buy copies, I\nsuppose, and cut out their letters, and stick them in albums.\"\n\nHe laughed. \"I shouldn't wonder,\" he said. \"Making personal friends for the\npaper--that's what Mr. Pole calls it. He says that nothing pays better.\"\n\n\"And presently, perhaps, you'll collect all the letters, and put them in\na little booklet of which you'll sell large numbers for sixpence in a\ncomfortable dressing-gown of advertisements.\"\n\n\"Possibly,\" he said, \"if it goes really well.\"\n\nI looked at him for a moment, upon the threshold of his life-work. He\nwas a nice boy, though the shades of Franciscan House were fast closing\nabout him. \"D'you think it's worth it?\" I asked him. \"Why rather,\" he said. \"Pays like anything.\"\n\n\"Forty per cent, perhaps?\"\n\n\"Very likely.\"\n\n\"The Franciscan heaven,\" I admitted, and he winced a little. By which I\nknew, of course, that he was as yet no true Franciscan--who never\nwinces, and whose conscience, to use a borrowed phrase, is merely his\naccomplice. \"Do you object to forty per cent?\" he asked. \"_Per se?_\" I answered, \"not at all.\"\n\n\"But to the correspondence perhaps?\"\n\n\"I'm not enamoured of the idea,\" I confessed. \"Are you?\"\n\nHe reached for the ash-tray, and knocked out his pipe. \"We must give 'em what they want, you know,\" he said. I bowed. \"The Franciscan creed,\" I told him. \"But perhaps they don't know yet\nthat they do want it.\"\n\n\"Then we must show 'em,\" he replied. \"The Franciscan gospel,\" I sighed, for, as I have said, he was a nice\nboy, still trailing a wisp or two of glory. \"And besides,\" he went on, \"people always like to talk about their weak\nnerves, don't they?\"\n\nHe was getting in under my guard now to bleed me of copy, so I stepped\naside. \"Play cricket?\" I asked him. \"A bit,\" he confessed. \"Ever stopped a rot?\"\n\n\"Sometimes,\" he replied warily. \"How did you do it?\" I inquired. He laughed again. \"Now you're getting at me, aren't you?\" he said. \"Of course I am. Haven't you been trying to get at me?\"\n\n\"Do you think you're going to score?\" he asked. \"I shouldn't wonder,\" I told him; \"because you didn't encourage those\npanicky fellow-batsmen of yours to talk about their nerves, did you? On\nthe contrary, you swaggered a bit yourself, and told 'em that the\nbowling was poor stuff. You didn't even tell 'em to forget that growing\nexcavation behind their belt-buckles. You were subtler. You took it for\ngranted that they hadn't got one. You surrounded 'em with the proper\natmosphere. You were more than half a nerve specialist already--the\nbetter half. You infected them with your own health. But what are you\nproposing to do now?\"\n\nThe journalist in him died hard. \"Then you think there _is_ a rot?\" he asked. \"I didn't say so.\"\n\nHe put his pipe in his pocket, and picked up his hat and gloves. \"After all,\" he smiled, \"you've only been preaching the old doctrine of\nresponsibility, you know. And the modern journalist is a detached\nperson.\" But I shook my head. I repeat that he was a nice boy, and had borne my little pi-jaw with\nadmirable fortitude.",

I repeat that he was a nice boy, and had borne my little pi-jaw with\nadmirable fortitude. \"Only semi-detached,\" I ventured, \"with a half-educated brother next\ndoor.\"\n\nI fancy that I can see you lying snugly aft upon the \"Nautilus\" at\nanchor--a bronzing cynic, smiling gently over this ingenuous little\nduel. And perhaps you have already made up your mind to transfer this\nincomplete disciple of yours to some other department, or even\n(according to a fundamental Franciscan tradition) to dispense with his\nservices altogether. For if he cannot bring himself to demolish one\nprehistoric physician, what can he do? And I shall be sorry if he is put\nto any real inconvenience. But on the other hand I shall rejoice openly\nto see him save his soul alive. For though I didn't tell him so, and\nthough I am convinced that at the core--the germ-plasm, if you like--the\nrace is still happily sound enough, yet if there is a rot, a temporary\nepidemic of nervous instability, it is largely confined to those who\ndraw their mental nourishment from Franciscan House, and whose\ntwitterings you are now proposing to exploit. _Autres temps, autres moeurs_, for while there was a time when our\nmore ignorant forefathers were wont to scoff (mistakenly, no doubt, but\non balance with a tonic effect) at the possessors of \"weak nerves,\" now\nthat we have learned just enough to talk about them in bad Greek\n\"neurasthenia\" is an affection of which no man need be ashamed. \"Poor\nchap,\" we say, and begin to wonder if we are not sufferers ourselves. You will have observed that my reference is masculine, although the\nolder historians have regarded the complaint as being chiefly confined\nto women. But you are not to deduct from this, as I can see you trying\nto do, that the neurasthenia of to-day is therefore a new variety, whose\nexhibition in your halfpenny daily paper is justifiable on public\ngrounds. For if it attacked mainly a certain class of our\ngreat-grandmothers and their maternal ancestors, this was less, I think,\non account of their sex than of their circumstances--the predisposing\ncombination in some of them of slender academic endowment with\nunexercised mental activity. Times have changed, but even then it was not the woman of affairs, whose\neducation, ample or the reverse, had been salted by the winds of\naction--it was not the queens and the stateswomen at the one pole, or\nthe workers in the fields at the other, but the secluded gentlewomen\nbetween them, who fainted daily, and agonised over beetles and mice. _Requiescant in pace_, for their day is no more, and their busier\ndaughters have no longer time to write pathetic little self-revelations\nin unventilated boudoirs, or collapse at a knock upon the door. Instead,\nthey will vault nimbly over the window-sill; while as for the beetles,\nthey will kill them for you mercifully, and explain their pedigree in\nLatin. But the class that they have thus vacated has not, alas, been suffered\nto die out, and is now perhaps even fuller than ever. Gone, it is true,\nwith the conditions that produced them, are the vaporous women of\nRichardson and Fielding. But here in their stead, and in a very similar\nsoil, is the twopenny clerk of to-day. And it is typically in his\nHarringay villa that one must search for the modern neurasthenic. A\nlittle cheap education, a long period of physical security, a\ncomfortable, if inexpensive, assurance of at any rate the more primal\nnecessities, and the demand of ever coalescing industries for an\ninnumerable army of semi-automatic dependents--all these have been at\nwork. And they have built up for us a hundred airless mental chambers,\nwhose inhabitants, desperately aware of their gentility, and\nsufficiently educated for a little self-probing, have nothing more\ndemanded from them than to copy out stereotyped letters or manipulate a\nMorse key. To obtain their chance of doing these things they had to\nacquire a small amount of knowledge--since seldom added to; and to do\nthem automatically a few months of mental apprenticeship became\nnecessary. No more was asked of them. And after a little while, and in\nthe great majority of cases, they have ceased to ask more of themselves. And I have seen men crying in my consulting-room over some trivial,\nunexpected appeal that has been too much for their paralysed initiative. You may think that my analogy is far-fetched, and superficially I'll\nadmit that it is. But probe a little deeper, and you'll find how exactly\nthe related conditions have produced corresponding types. Look at my\nsequestered lady busy with her eternal crochet, but in reality not busy\nat all. And then behold my little clerk occupied with his letters and\nhis envelope-licking, but with a brain as really unemployed as my\nlady's.

Read out to me the writings of my sequestered lady or the\nrecords of her conversations. How little she had read or seen or\nstudied, and yet with what confident persistence she uttered her\nsuperlatives. And now talk to my little clerk, who likewise has climbed\nno mountains of comparison, and his tiniest headache is \"shocking,\" his\nleast calamity \"terrible.\" Why, only this afternoon I was asked for a\ntonic by such an one (your halfpenny illustrated was peeping out of his\npocket) on the ground that yesterday he had seen a small child cut its\nforehead, and held it till the doctor came. Listen to my sequestered\nlady, innocence herself, and her talk, with titters, is of my lord's\n_liaisons_, my lady's cure, and what the neighbours think. And listen to\nmy little clerk, and what are his topics but these? God forbid that I should hold either of them up for ridicule (it's you\nthat I'm ultimately to annihilate), for such generalities as these are\nnever more than half true. My lady was only waiting for the marching\nyears to become a Florence Nightingale and a Madame Curie. She was only\nwaiting to be shown, and admitted into, the great worlds outside her\nboudoir to prove a right of way that has long since ceased to be\nquestioned. And who shall say what shining destiny awaits my little\nclerk? For it is not, as we are so often told, the mere rush of our\nmodern industrialism that is at the root of so much neurasthenia--it is\nits blank automatism, with its endless opportunities for self-pity. And\none can only suppose that as we advance in knowledge much of this human\ndrudgery will be delegated to other instruments. But the time is not\nyet, alas, and meanwhile all that is best of him has to struggle with\ncircumstances only too sorrowfully adapted to morbid mental imaginings. \"The result of all this free education,\" you will be told by a certain\ntype of elderly _raisonneur_. But of course he is wrong. It's not less\neducation that we want, but more. For even in the good old days, as I\nhave said, it was not the Marie Stuarts and the Queen Elizabeths,\ndelivering their Latin orations and translating their \"Mirrors of the\nSinful Soul\" at thirteen and fourteen years old, it was not the\nfull-tide women of the Renaissance, who were afterwards conspicuous for\nnervous debility. And nor is it the really well-educated clerk of\nto-day. For while a little education is chiefly dangerous in so far as\nit increases a man's self-consciousness without showing him where it is\ngently to be laughed at, a little more will generally remedy this\ndefect, to the lasting benefit of his sanity. No, it's in his awful\nself-seriousness that lurks the subtlest enemy of the half-educated man. If you can make a man laugh at himself, you can make him laugh at his\nnerves--which is better than a hecatomb of bromides. Well then, there's my analogy; and here's where it breaks down. My\nlady's prison walls were concrete as well as abstract; my clerk's are\nchiefly abstract. She was in the world but not of it. He is both in it\nand of it. She could scarcely touch upon its treasures if she would. For him they are waiting--the real ones--if he will only take them. Long\nago we have recognised the merely physical dangers of his daily enforced\nimprisonment. And we have framed a hundred sanitary laws to provide him\nwith his oxygen unsullied.

    "text": "XXIII\n\n_To Miss Sarah Harding, The Orphanage, Little Blessington, Dorset._\n\n 91B HARLEY STREET, W.,\n _September_ 6, 1910. MY DEAR SALLY,\n\nThere was a young American, Stephen Crane, who wrote, a few years ago, a\nlittle volume called \"Wounds in the Rain.\" You may have read it. It was\nrather a grim book, but written with a good deal of power, and a promise\nof more to come that the author, alas, never lived to fulfil. And not\nthe worst part of it was its title, with its suggestion of grey\nsuffering, the aftermath alike of victory and defeat. And yet I am not\nsure that \"Wounds in the Sun\" would not literally have stood for a far\ngreater sum of misery. Only he would never have made us feel it. For there's an implicit sadness in the monosyllable rain--in the very\nsound of it--that depends, I think, when you come to analyse it, less\nupon the ideas of water and wetness and possible chill that it conjures\nup, than upon an underlying suggestion of something falling. It's a\nlittle hard to account for it--I would commend the subject to a\nmetaphysician if I could be certain that it hasn't already been dealt\nwith by him--and yet it's a fact, I think, that we have invested all\nfalling things with a certain quality of tragedy, with at any rate no\nsingle idea of cheerfulness. Think of what you will, from little Susan's\ntear to Lucifer, son of the Morning, and of all the more material\nphenomena that lie between them--cascades, avalanches, autumn\nleaves--and you will find that while your vision perceives in them pity,\nor solemnity, or terror, or even disgust, it clothes no falling thing\nwith actual joy. And the swifter the fall the more profound are these\nsentiments that it engenders. Thus the sheer waterfall, spilling itself unbroken over some brooding\ncrag into a pit of blackness, contains just so much more gloom than the\ntorrent, leaping down from rock to rock, as its descent is more vertical\nand headlong. The thistledown, sliding earthwards upon the wind, is less\ntragic than the rain-sodden beech-leaf by just the measure of its longer\npassage through the air. While the rain that drives horizontally against\none's Burberry may be a good deal more penetrating, but is seldom so\ndismal as that which drops down undisturbed from the drab sky to earth. I believe that there is a sermon in all this somewhere--in the universal\ninstinct with which we find sorrow, or at least some factor of it, in\nall that falls; and joy, or at any rate its suggestion, in most things\nthat rise up, and open, and turn themselves towards the heavens. But\nI'll spare you the preaching of it, since these reflections merely\nspring to my mind as the result, last Saturday, of a particularly wet\ntramp from Beer to Sidmouth. I had been called down in consultation on Friday, and having spent the\nnight in the sick man's house, decided next morning to walk the eight\nmiles along the coast. It was one of those baffling Devonshire mornings\nof rain and mist with rhythmical promises, never fulfilled, of a watery\nsunshine to come; and both my hostess and the local doctor were fain to\npress motor-cars upon me. But I had made up my mind, and assured them\nthat I was one of those many people--possibly foolish--who rather\nenjoyed a walk in the rain. My host, who was by way of being a philosopher as well as an invalid,\nlooked at me with a twinkle. \"So you really think you like it?\" he asked me. \"Yes,\" I told him. \"I really do like it.\"\n\nHe put a hand on my shoulder. \"No, you don't,\" he said. \"Just think it over between here and\nSidmouth.\"\n\nAnd he was right. Before I had walked two miles I knew that he was\nright. I don't enjoy walking in the rain, though I often do it, and\nalways claim to like it. I merely walk in it for the rather subtle\nenjoyment of getting out of it, and for the sake of plumbing a little\nmore deeply, at my journey's end, the everyday delights of dryness,\nwarmth, and a deep-bosomed chair. I become a Tibetan at the prayer-wheel\nstoring up joys to come in a whetted appetite for to-morrow's blue sky. For though I must admit that there's a certain decorative effect about\nrain over a countryside, yet it's an effect of pure melancholy,\nscientifically unfounded of course--at any rate until science can\nexplain the proposition at the beginning of this letter--heightening\nloneliness, exaggerating the hardship of toil, deepening the horror of\ndeath, but adding quite an extraordinary power to any gleam of even the\ntearfullest of sunshine that may have stumbled into some corner of the\nlandscape. And there's always the possibility of that gleam being the\nherald of a sudden conquest of glory, in whose triumph your merely\nfair-weather pedestrian can never have a part. Thus a memory comes back to me, for instance, of a dreary\nfive-in-the-morning start, a hopeless breakfast, a dogged rain-soaked\ntramp up the steep hillside--and then the summit of Ben Lomond, a very\nark above the flood, borne up, as it were, into the midmost sanctuary of\nheaven, with the submerging seas rolling out to the world's end, and the\nwind thrilling over them like an organ. Ten minutes ago, and the sun had\nlost itself for ever. And now it flamed there like the white throne of\nGod, till the horizons melted before its gaze, and the great dead began\nmajestically to rise--Ben More, Ben Lawers, the Cairngorms, and the\ndistant peaks of Arran. My sunshine on Saturday last however was not, I should think, more than\ntwelve years old.",

She was standing rather pensively (but without\nagitation) near a cottage gate; and fortunately I had provided myself\nwith some bulls'-eyes at a village called Branscombe, where a kindly old\nlady had assured me that there was still a great demand for them. I\nextracted one from the bag, and was thanked politely but by no means\ndeferentially. There was a moment's pause during which a damp physician\nwas being gravely relegated to his proper sphere in the natural scheme\nof things--an obviously humble one. Then she threw me a fact. \"Nellie arn't got one,\" she observed. So I gave her one for Nellie. \"Anybody else?\" I inquired. She looked down for a minute at the plump and striped confection. \"Mother likes _them_ things,\" she said--and I had seen by this time, of\ncourse, that her mother must be a very nice mother. So she accepted one\nfor mother. \"And is that all?\" I asked. \"Well,\" she said doubtfully, \"_Baby's_ just arf to sleep.\"\n\nAnd this is all that I shall ever remember about the road from Beer to\nSidmouth. I am finding it harder than ever this year to get a summer holiday. And\nwhile these little glimpses of the country merely sharpen my desire for\nmore, I find myself telling myself sternly that I must really learn to\nbe contented with them. And at any rate I have been enabled to see more\nof the hospital than for some time past; and, as you know, this is to be\nmy last year there as a visiting physician. This afternoon, my junior being salmon-fishing in Norway, I thought\nthat I would take the out-patients for the first time in twelve years;\nand the clinical assistant proving not unwilling to go and play tennis,\nI amused myself with seeing the lot of them. For there's no other\ncommentary upon men and manners quite like a collection of out-patients\nat a large hospital. Listen therefore to a stalwart gentleman who earns\ntwenty shillings a week, and doesn't stint himself in beer. \"Debility, doctor,\" he said, \"that's what's the metter with me.\" He\ndropped his voice huskily. \"Domestic trouble,\" he added. \"Dear me,\" I sympathised, feeling his pulse. \"Serious?\"\n\n\"Twins,\" he said gloomily; \"second lot I've 'ed in eighteen months; an'\nI think it's run me down.\"\n\n Your aff. brother,\n PETER.",

    "text": "XXIV\n\n_To the Rev. Bruce Harding, S. Peter's College, Morecambe Bay._\n\n c/o HARRY CARTHEW, CROME LODGE,\n NEAR CAVERSHAM, BERKS,\n _September_ 14, 1910. MY DEAR BRUCE,\n\nI am very glad to hear that you have had such an excellent holiday in\nSwitzerland, and brought home four or five more mountain scalps to your\nCumberland wigwam. But it's rather sad that the little storm that was\nbrewing at S. Peter's before you left should have burst in thunder and\nlightning during your absence. Knowing both Merridew and Rogers, I quite\nagree with you that it was probably inevitable, and may ultimately tend\nto a clearer atmosphere. Meanwhile however the little community makes\nwar from opposite camps, and there is a great deal of unnecessary\nbitterness in their tactics that seems likely to increase when Rogers\ncomes back from London. And, as you say, it's all rather sad and sordid,\nand only humorous because the parish is so small and the whole storm\ncontained, as it were, in one of its afternoon teacups. But then most\nparishes are comparatively small, and we all have to live in one or\nother of them, and storms in teacups are apt to be just as devastating\nas any other kind of storm--even more so perhaps, because it's so much\neasier on these occasions to insist upon recommending one's own\nparticular infusion of tannin, than to insert instead an unobtrusive\ndrop or two of the calming milk of human kindness. Whereas cyclones have\na habit of setting us shoulder to shoulder, by virtue of the unanimous\ndiscovery that they rather suddenly engender of the extraordinary\nunimportance of our differences. So on the whole I'm with you in preferring cyclones, although at first I\nwas rather inclined to disagree with your assertion that this little\nflare-up between Rogers and your new vicar was merely a somewhat\nexaggerated instance of the general underlying hostility that seems to\nexist between Medicine and the Church. I was for pointing out to you, with some vigour, the fact that we both\nhave friends, not a few, in the consulting-room and cloth respectively,\nto whom we can talk with a complete frankness, and in the assurance of a\nreciprocated understanding. And yet, on second thoughts, I am\nreluctantly sure that you are right, and that, speaking in very general\nterms, there does exist some such feeling as you have named--less\nhostility, perhaps, than a decently veiled distrust. It's a little hard\nto see why this should be the case. For there would appear superficially\nto be at least a hundred reasons why the precisely opposite should be\ntrue. Perhaps the foundation of it is historical. Centuries enough have\nnot yet rolled away since medicine came out of the side of priestcraft;\nso that on the one hand there is still an occasional smarting of the old\nwound, and on the other a little over-insistence, perhaps, upon a\ncomplete and rather superior liberty--tradition still looming somewhat\nlargely in the education of the young clergyman, and reverence being\nnot, perhaps, a particularly prominent feature in the training of his\nmedical brother. In any case, there it is; and though I think that\nRogers has been wrong, or at any rate tactless, in his opposition to the\nextra services that Merridew wishes to hold in the cottage hospital, it\nseems to me that your two protagonists are very typical of all that is\nbest (and possibly least reconcilable) on either side. For on the one\nhand you have Merridew, ardent, sincere, sacerdotal, and very nearly\nyoung enough to account for, though not of course to justify, Rogers's\nrudeness in referring to him as \"the boy from Cuddesdon.\" And on the\nother, you have Rogers, equally genuine, generous, uncompromising, and\nalmost fiercely insistent in his demand for intellectual honesty. Indeed\nI think his rather truculent materialism is far more an expression of\nthis desire than an exact creed of his personal belief. And both men, it\nseems to me, are so obviously the logical products of their respective\nupbringings. Of Merridew's I can only speak of course as an outsider. His father,\nwhom I knew very slightly, was himself a clergyman of the old High\nChurch type, moderately wealthy, refined to the uttermost, acutely\nsensitive, artistic, yet as rigid in his standards as any Cromwellian\nIronside. He was happily married, and his home--and young\nMerridew's--was, almost necessarily, like himself. Merridew was the only\nchild, and when his father died, while he was still at Lancing, it was\nonly natural that he should resolve to enter the Church, and that his\nmother should henceforth devote herself almost entirely to his welfare\nand to the furtherance of these boyish resolutions. Leaving Lancing, he\nwent up to his father's old college at Cambridge, commended to his\ntutors, and known to his fellow-undergraduates, from the outset, as a\ncandidate for Holy Orders. And here--again as a perfectly accepted\nconsequence--he took his degree in classics, and dabbled a little in\nhistory. He was not unpopular. His ardour, never awkward, procured him\nmany friends and indeed followers among like-minded youths with a\nsimilar future in front of them; and, being adequately athletic, he was\non friendly, if not intimate, terms with a good many others. At\ntwenty-two or so he left Cambridge for Cuddesdon, and at twenty-four he\nobtained a curacy in Hoxton, where he overworked himself for four years. He was then, I think, an assistant priest at a fashionable church in\nKensington, until he was presented by one of his uncles with the living\nof S. Peter's. Those are the external facts, and, as a guesser from the\nopposite camp, I may very likely go wrong in estimating their inner\nsignificances.",

Those are the external facts, and, as a guesser from the\nopposite camp, I may very likely go wrong in estimating their inner\nsignificances. But it seems to me--and in talking with Merridew I am\nalways conscious of this--that as the inevitable result of this training\nhe has been surrounded by a kind of protective aura, now almost\nimpenetrable, that has interposed itself, as it were, between himself,\nas an anointed priest, and the great tides of actual life that go\nsurging about him. Little by little it was created for him by his\nparents. The vicissitudes of school life made him cling to it only the\nmore firmly. Cambridge, and the conspiracy of silence that, to a lesser\nextent, surrounds the embryo and younger clergy as certainly as it does\ntheir sisters at home, merely strengthened it fourfold; so that when he\nleft Cuddesdon there it was complete--his lifebelt for the conflicting\nseas of reality--and not only about his waist, but also to a large\nextent encircling his intellect. For if you examine his education you\nwill find, I think, that never in all that time was he encouraged, for\nhimself and by himself, to discover, to classify, to co-relate, one\nsingle naked fact of real existence. Science was then, and has always\nbeen, in its inward sense, a thing unknown to him. Of the living stuff\nof humanity he was given not the smallest primary notion. And his\nobservation of it since has been that of a man who has never been\nequipped with the first unprejudiced principles of observation at all. Of heredity and psychology he knows not a line. And of their results in\nactual character and conduct he can perceive, as a rule, only as much as\nthe normal man will reveal to the present type of normal parson--while\neven of that he has never been given the wherewithal to judge. Rogers, on the other hand, was the son of a small Northampton milliner. At the age of fourteen he ran away to sea, where he served for four\nyears in all sorts of ships, in all sorts of capacities. It was on one\nof these that some rough and ready, but skilful, surgery, by which a\nyoung ship's doctor removed some broken bone from the brain of a comrade\nwho had fallen from the rigging, first fired him with the desire to be a\nsurgeon. He returned home to find his father dead and his mother in\nstraitened circumstances. He got work in a boot factory, and studied at\nnight schools for his preliminary examination. Having passed this, he\nwent back to sea for a year, and then, coming up to London, he managed\nto attend at hospital by day, while he kept himself as dispenser,\nbottle-washer, and general handy man to a dispensing practitioner in his\nspare hours. By this means, and with the aid of a scholarship or two, he obtained his\ndiplomas, and started a cash surgery near Waterloo. Five years later he\nwas a Fellow of the College of Surgeons, and in another three had become\na member of his hospital staff. For a year or so he found it pretty hard\nto make both ends meet behind his modest plate (one of five) upon a\nfront door in Harley Street. But then the tide began to turn. A\nbrilliant paper or two marked him out as a coming man. A new and\nadmirable method of performing a certain cerebral operation became\nassociated with his name. And in ten years' time he had become perhaps\nthe foremost brain surgeon in London. Twelve years after this he lost a\nhand, in consequence of a post-mortem infection, but retired a wealthy\nman, though at first a rather disconsolate one. For a time his love of\nthe sea reasserted itself, and he travelled. Then, as you know, he found\na retreat that suited him on the shores of Cumberland, where he has\nbuilt, endowed, and kept lavishly up-to-date the little cottage hospital\nabout which your teacup storm is raging. You may tell me, perhaps, that both Rogers and Merridew are extreme\ninstances. But if they are, it is in degree only and not in kind. For\nbehind Rogers I can see a large and quickly growing army of thinking men\nand women, risen like him from what are called the masses, vigorous of\nmind and hard of muscle, men accustomed to deal with life at first hand,\ntrained to observe, quick to deduct, unhampered, if perhaps a little too\nunmoved by tradition, state-makers, explorers, and men withal not\nimpervious to, but on the contrary almost passionately eager for the\ntruth. And behind Merridew I can see many, if not most, of his brethren, men of\nfine instincts and real devotedness--narrow-minded in none but the most\nliteral sense, and in that merely because of the school that has moulded\nthem--men who would cheerfully give all that they possess to be able to\ninfluence in any substantial degree the great world's dreamers and\ndoers. And behind them again I can see their Church.",

And behind them again I can see their Church. * * * * *\n\nCuriously enough, we have just been discussing something of all this\nupon Carthew's Thames-side lawn. We had crossed the river in the\nmorning, and walked up, about a couple of miles, to a neighbouring\nvillage church. And now, as I write to you in the boat under the\nwillows, they seem to me--the temple and its service--to have been\nalmost tragically symbolic. The village itself, on the outskirts of\nReading, consists of a rustic core, about which time and circumstance\nhave wrapped several red-brick layers, the innermost containing workers\nfrom the various shops and factories of the neighbouring town, together\nwith a sprinkling of day-labourers in the country round; and the outer\naccommodating some superior clerks and their families, a few of the more\nsubstantial Reading tradesmen, and the inevitable retired colonel. Most of these, as we passed upon our way, were smoking over the Sunday\npapers in their front gardens, or preparing for a morning to be spent\nupon the river; and the church was far from their midst, a mile in fact\nbeyond their extremest outskirts. Moreover the day was hot, and the road\nto it dusty. The building itself was neither old nor new, and we were shown into a\npew beneath a large stained-glass window that almost immediately began,\nin spite of myself, to monopolise my attention. The congregation\nconsisted, of course, mainly of women. (\"It will be the same in the\nHereafter,\" my Aunt Josephine once assured me when commenting upon the\nsame phenomenon.) But there were about thirty men present, for the most\npart gnarled and sunburnt sons of the field, in uncomfortable,\nready-made suits--men, as I guessed, in whose veins there still ran\nsomething of the older homage once shared by parson and squire. What was\nthis particular parson going to give them, I wondered, as mental and\nmoral food for the week's sustenance? His delivery of the prayers and\nlessons was not very promising. It was not that he had any physical\nimpediment in his speech. It was merely that he had never been taught to\nproduce his sounds effectively, and that Oxford and his clubs had\nsuccessfully schooled him into eliminating any tincture of emotion from\ntheir quality. But he might still, of course, have a message in waiting\nfor us from the pulpit. He preached upon the value of communicating before breakfast; and, as\nfar as I could see, his remarks upon the subject were received,\nespecially by the male portion of his congregation, with the same kind\nof curious, impassive gusto that had been noticeable in their delivery\nof the responses and the hymns. I remember a verse of one of these, and\nam quoting it exactly:\n\n Whatever, Lord, we lend to Thee\n Repaid a thousandfold will be;\n _Then_ gladly will we give to Thee,\n Who givest all. Could they have known what they were singing? Had their vicar read these\nlines before he gave them out? Let us hope not. But, as I said, it was the stained-glass window that dominated me, and\nseemed to contain in itself an epitome--yet not quite that, perhaps--of\nsermon and service and hymn, and the system that had made their survival\npossible in twentieth-century England. And yet, let me first put down\nthat through it came light, real if distorted, and distilled, but how\nfaintly, from the true arch of the outside heaven. And let me not forget\nthis as I go on to remember its eight divisions, containing each a\nworshipping and apparently musical young woman, arrayed as no being has\never been arrayed, and regarding with upturned eyes--well, fortunately\nthe artist had stopped short there, though merely, one fears, from want\nof space. I have called these maidens musical for the rather inadequate\nreason that in the hands of each were instruments by and through which\nsounds might conceivably be produced.

But at the nature of these one\ncould, alas, guess only too readily. Even in the grasp of experts one\nwould have been justly dubious about the capabilities of those\ntwo-stringed violins, that one-keyed portable organ, those twin-trumpets\nwith a common mouthpiece.

Could\nthese sallow-cheeked saints, these obviously unhealthy, ill-nourished,\nincapable young women, tell anything worth the hearing upon any single\nplane of thought or conduct to the men and women of 1910? Could they\nindeed preach any other possible sermon than to cry out to all would-be\nhealthy people to flee away from them into the outer sunshine? Were they\neven justified as reflections, infinitely remote, of the pale Galilean\nof Gautier and Swinburne? And was there in fact ever a pale Galilean,\nthe least of Whose doctrines they could ever imaginably have embodied? Was that sturdy, sun-browned Youth, with His carpenter's wrists and His\nphysical endurance, with His undreamed spiritual forces and His splendid\nsanity in their control, with the glory of His emancipating conceptions\nand His divine simplicity in their exposition--was He ever such as to be\nthus pallidly worshipped save in the twilight imageries of earlier\ncenturies and the resentful poetry of rebellious thinkers? And I\ncouldn't help wondering if my stained-glass window had perhaps cast its\nspell not only upon the aisles, but the authority of the Church that had\nset it up. Only a year or two ago, for instance, I remember being assured by a\nyouthful priest from Cambridge, who had scarcely ever stirred beyond his\nEast End settlement, that, while he would refrain from setting a limit\nto God's mercy, no man could really be considered safe who had not made\nverbal confession of his sins to himself or one of his brothers. And\nonly last week, upon the beach at Swanage, I heard another young\nclergyman, of a rather more so-called evangelical way of thinking, most\npositively assuring a ring of little children that the Devil was even\nthen whispering in their ears what a good time he would like to give\nthem. No wonder that the Carthews and the Rogers' stand aside, and wait\nimpatiently for the coming of the New Word or of the Old one as it was. And no wonder that men and women, more really religious now, perhaps,\nthan ever in history, look on at it all rather dubiously in a healthy\nhesitation, or turn frankly away to the tennis-lawn and river. I have been watching them all the afternoon plying their oars here upon\nthe Thames--strong and ruddy, keen-faced artisans from Reading,\nactresses from town, barristers, doctors, men of leisure, and men of\naffairs. And now, as I write, they are plying still, while across the\nfields comes the ineffectual call of the various ecclesiastical bells. By some they are not even heard, I suppose. They are singing choruses\nfrom \"Our Miss Gibbs.\" To others they are just decorative in the region\nof river sounds, as the loose-strife and charlock in that of its\ncolours. To a few they must even be merely sad. They might mean--they\nonce have meant--so much to their country's seething life. And now they\nwould seem to contain almost less significance than the gramophone in\nthe steam-launch round the corner. A few moments ago the Bishop, Carthew's newly-acquired brother-in-law,\nwas leaning forward in his chair. \"If you knew,\" he said, \"the real agony with which the Church has to\nface these problems.\"\n\nCarthew nodded. \"Yes,\" he said slowly, \"parturition's always painful--especially to the\nelderly--but the price for shirking it----\"\n\n\"Is sterility,\" said the Bishop. \"I know. But we don't want your pity. We want your help.\"\n\nCarthew knocked the ashes out of his pipe. \"Then first,\" he said, \"you must get rid of those lifebelts, where the\nrace goes past them, and teach your clergy to swim. And then you must\nkeep 'em swimming. And you must see that they swim first. Don't stultify\ntheir efforts by askin' 'em to square impossible traditions with new\ntruths, or medi\u00e6val ethics with essential Christianity. Don't call 'em\nunsound because they have inklings inside 'em that Revelation didn't\ncease with St. John or interpretation with the Epistle to the Hebrews. Let 'em have Visions of their own. Tell 'em to go out, and make\ndiscoveries. Let 'em dare to be simple--really simple, that is. And\ntrust God and human kindness to do the rest.\"\n\nI don't think that he was speaking lightly, but the Bishop looked at him\nfor a moment rather closely. \"You're a believer?\" he said. \"You don't mind my asking?\"\n\n\"Not a bit,\" said Carthew. \"I'm a believer. And what's more, I'm a\nbeliever in an organised, visible Church, not because it's vital, but\nbecause it's expedient. Only its stained-glass windows, if they _must_\nbe stained, should contain blacksmiths and boxers and wireless\ntelegraphists, with some bank clerks and a bus driver, and of course\nsome children.\" Mrs. Carthew had just brought out the twins, \"for of\nsuch is the Kingdom of Heaven.\"\n\n Your affect. cousin,\n PETER HARDING. P.S.--Rogers is coming to dinner with us, as you suggested, before he\ngoes back to Cumberland.",

    "text": "XXV\n\n_To Hugh Pontrex, Villa Rosa, Mentone._\n\n 91B HARLEY STREET, W.,\n _October_ 3, 1910. MY DEAR HUGH,\n\nWhen you write and ask me to tell you what books I read during my\nillness I can see an ancient accusation of yours peering at me behind\nthe question--as though you had visibly added that, except when\nindisposed, I never read books at all. And if it weren't that I too find\nother people's reading so interesting, though less informing perhaps\nthan their pictures, I might possibly stand upon my dignity, and decline\nto supply you with an answer. And in any case, now that I come to\nreflect a little, this will be rather a difficult thing to do. For\nhaving got me at a disadvantage, you see, I could no longer pick and\nchoose, as is my wont when the health within me is rude and exacting. I\ncould no longer demand haughtily of a book that it must make me read it,\nor remain within its covers for ever unread. My defences were down, and\nI had perforce to roll over, hands up, for anything in the shape of book\nwith which Accident and Mudie had happened to endow my house. And as a\nresult I read half a dozen novels that, as the Americans say, left me\ncold, although I must needs give them the credit of having whiled away\nthe time. Moreover, before dismissing them thus unkindly, I must\nremember that they were each the work of somebody's hand and brain, and\nthe hard work too--at any rate so far as the hand was concerned--as\nanyone who has tried to put eighty thousand words of even unimaginative\nEnglish upon paper would surely bear witness. Some of it too, one could\nsee, was the rather tired work of minds that should really have been\n(perhaps only too willingly) lying fallow of production. And I think\nthat I noticed this particularly in an altogether unimportant little\nvolume called \"Daisy's Aunt\" by Mr. E. F. Benson, that may well stand\nfor a sorrowful example. It's true that it was merely a two-shilling\nstory; but even so, it was surely an unworthy one. And yet, I suppose,\nthere _is_ a public that likes to devour these descriptions of very\nordinary London drawing-rooms and very usual Thames-side bungalows--that\nwould fain listen to even the weariest repetitions of the somewhat\nannoying slang of the \"oh you heavenly person\" type that for the moment\nis being affected by Mr. Benson's \"quite nice people.\" And having thus\nfound, or created, such a public, and designed the precise bait that it\nrequires, I suppose that one is justified in hooking, as often as may\nbe, one's share of their two-shilling pieces. But alas for the artist in\nMr. Benson, in whose books there have been passages good enough of their\nkind to have made, perhaps, three or four pieces of real literature that\nfew, I suppose, would have bought, but that some, at any rate, would\nhave liked to keep upon their shelves. And yet again, who is to say that\nMr. Benson (as representing not a few) has not after all chosen his\nbetter way? For if his popularity has been costly, it is at any rate of\na clean and healthy sort, and one that may well, perhaps, be\nsubstituting itself for vogues unworthier and less wholesome. They form an interesting study, these three brothers, not merely in\nheredity of talent, but because, as it seems to me, they stand very high\nin that small but growing band of really able writers, who possess also\nthe knack of a popular appeal. The sons of a religious, scholarly, and\ndiscreet father, who himself had the power of attracting both attention\nand success, these qualities, with no suspicion of a more wayward\ngenius, have descended upon them in very generous measure. The social\nsense, the faculty of choosing the right friends, and a gift for getting\nthem on paper; the high purpose, clerically moulded; the gentle inward\nwarring of trained intellect and instinctive orthodoxy; to each has\nfallen a share of his father's mantle, wherewith to make himself a\ngarment. And the mental pabulum that they provide is just what is wanted\nby a large number of active, intelligent men and women to whom genius is\nat all times unsympathetic; and by the yet greater company--including\nmost of us, I suppose--to whom its strongest appeal is a matter of mood\nand place. Every generation seems to provide itself with such writers,\nand as a rule rewards them well; and while, no doubt, it is genius alone\nthat survives, with a light that can never remain hidden, the others, by\ntheir more instant and transient appeal, do yeoman work, and are\ngathered honourably to their fathers. For we may not always be tuned to\nthe tang of Stevenson or the burr of Dr. John Brown. But we are seldom\nincapable of sitting with enjoyment at some College Window, or allowing\nthe lesser voices to prepare us for those that are mightier than they. And never, perhaps, has a generation possessed so many of these. Never\ncertainly has their level of eloquence been so high. Hichens and Locke\nand Anthony Hope, Phillpotts, Marriott, Munro, and Wells, with Hewlett\nand de Morgan a little nearer, perhaps, to the stars, and a score of\nothers close upon their heels--how sound and various is their artistry,\nand how consistent, as a whole, is the quality of their output. For\nthis, one thinks, must be the besetting danger of all these skilled\nprofessionals--to avoid, on the one hand, the Scylla of over-repetition\n(to which most of the monthly magazines were long ago safely anchored)\nand on the other, the more dangerous Charybdis of a too venturesome\nnovelty. Upon the first (and still confining oneself to the more\nconsiderable writers) Mr. Benson, the essayist, for example, would seem,\nmore nearly than many, to be in danger of foundering.",

Upon the first (and still confining oneself to the more\nconsiderable writers) Mr. Benson, the essayist, for example, would seem,\nmore nearly than many, to be in danger of foundering. While upon the\nsecond I can think of Conan Doyle as having bumped as badly as most\nwriters of an equal eminence. For while there is no man who can spin a\nbetter yarn for a dull journey (even if he has never given us a\nBrushwood Boy), his particular talent is about as at home among the\ndelicate domesticities of his \"Duet with an Occasional Chorus\" as would\nbe some genial pugilist with the \"Pot-pourri of a Surrey Garden.\" And\nyet, while one could pile up examples of sad wreckage upon both these\nrocks, the wonder, after all, is that there is really so little of it. Mr. Benson, no doubt, will put up his helm in time; and Sir Arthur has\nbeen wise enough, as far as I know, to avoid any further emulation of\nMrs. Gaskell and Miss Mitford. But it is, perhaps, to Mrs. Humphry Ward\nthat one naturally seems to turn for a demonstration of the completely\nmedian course--so rigidly median indeed, in its lofty mediocrity, that I\nam sometimes at a loss to account for her very great popularity even\namong (as the critics have called it) the circulating-library public. For though she has a gift, and a very considerable one, for bringing\ntogether the materials--a little machine-made, perhaps--of dramatic\nincident, one may search her books in vain for a single thrill that they\nhave produced; while of humour they contain not a semblance. Indeed they\nform, as it seems to me, a long series of admirably well-laid fires, for\nwhich only the matches are wanting. As Dr. Brown would have said, she is\nthe Maker, not the Mother, of her books. And I think hers must be the\ntwentieth-century triumph of the college-bred lady inspector. It's strange how increasingly one misses, when it is absent, this\nunderlying sense of humour; so much so indeed that one perceives it more\nand more to be a _sine qua non_ of all towering and durable achievement. Given Meredith's humour, how Hardy, with his first-hand observation, his\nextraordinary detachment, and the beautiful lucidity of his English,\nwould have loomed above the creator of Sir Willoughby. With humour for\nits lightning, how Tess would have stricken us to the heart. And how\npoor a substitute for it is irony, howsoever its subjects may deserve\nit. To withstand the years it must, no doubt, surround itself with the\nstronger qualities--depth and simplicity and desire--or Barrie, least of\nthe Immortals, would be among their giants; and Jacobs would be knocking\nat their door. But that Olympus demands it let all testify who have\ntried to love Sordello, or watched Jude fade ever deeper into his\nobscurity, or read again, a generation later, the rhapsodies of\nInglesant and Elsmere. There are a few exceptions of course, chiefly, I\nthink, in the sphere of the short story, the mere _conte_, and among the\npoets, of whom perhaps Wordsworth is the one that springs most readily\nto the mind. By the way, I saw a discussion (a rather unkindly one) in\none of the magazines, a year or two ago, as to the worst line in\nreputable poetry, and I am rather afraid that last Sunday I discovered\nit, and that Wordsworth must be regarded as its sponsor. Here it is, and\none grain of humour would surely have made it impossible. Spade! with which Wilkinson has tilled his land. And yet he has written a sonnet or two, and at least one ode, that are\nas immortal, I suppose, as anything in letters. But I don't seem to have told you very much about my bedside books. And\nthe truth of it is that \"Daisy's Aunt\" is the only title that I can\nremember, though it may conveniently be stretched, perhaps, to embrace\nthem all. For it concluded, if I remember rightly, with the matrimony of\nfour persons; and the others also are now a blur to me of ultimate\nmarriages--marriages between pathological pianists and high-born,\nintrospective damsels; and marriages between athletic young gentlemen,\ngood at puncture-mending, and the distressed maidens whose tyres had\nbecome deflated. Of the books, on the other hand, that have made me read them--rare and\nbeloved visitors--there have been fewer this year than usual, though it\nis I, and not the books, that must bear the chief blame for this.",

Of the books, on the other hand, that have made me read them--rare and\nbeloved visitors--there have been fewer this year than usual, though it\nis I, and not the books, that must bear the chief blame for this. The\ntwo latest of these, separated by an interval of months, and both, I\nbelieve, already elderly as the lives of modern novels go, are \"The\nCliff End\" and \"Captain Margaret.\" The first of these delighted me from\ncover to cover, in spite of some exaggerations of character-drawing and\ndialogue; and I reverently bow my head to its author as having made\nhimself at a bound the laureate, not only of the bath-tub, but of that\npeculiarly distressing variety of it that is very wide and shallow, with\na dimple in it that cracks when you stand upon it, and a capacity for\nwater that no housemaid has ever satisfied. It is perhaps too late for\nthe nature of this vessel to change. But never more, with that rosy\nvision of sponging maidenhood before my eyes, shall I regard it as\nanything but blessed. So it's a book for which I should like to prophesy life, though with\nless certainty, perhaps, than \"Captain Margaret,\" upon the deck of his\n_Broken Heart_, carries the very germ of it in his delicate hands. For\nto his eldorado of dreams we have all of us, at one time or another,\nturned our eyes. And in his schooner might have sailed any Quixote of\nhistory, lucky indeed to find a Cammock for his navigator. And yet who am I to be thus prophesying so boldly? For the third of my\nbooks has been a collection of Oscar Wilde's contributions to the \"Pall\nMall Gazette,\" full of such forecasts, and written, too, by a practised\nhand. Has one half of them been verified? I think not. And yet I suspect\nthat few critics could more equably confront a reprinting of their\ntwenty-year-old opinions. Looking through this book, I read, for\nexample, whole pages devoted to the novel of Miss So-and-so whom one\nwould have supposed, in the eighties, to have been an emerging George\nEliot. And how desperately must the praise have fired her to further\nefforts. Yet what, in 1910, has become of poor Miss So-and-so; and where\nare those great works that were so certainly to be? There is the writer\nhimself too, so young then, with his brilliant flippancies--his\nimpeachment of the British Cook, for instance, with her passion for\ncombining pepper and gravy and calling it soup, and her inveterate habit\nof sending up bread poultices with pheasant--and all his promises of\ngrace. So, upon the whole, it's a sad book; and here, for a brisker comment\nupon all that I have been writing, comes a volume of American essays\nthat has just been lent to Esther, wherein I am positively assured that\nthe volumes of Mrs. Humphry Ward are quite dangerously immoral! While\nthere, upon a chair, lies a novel, \"Mr. Meeson's Will,\" that Rupert\nMorris has just recommended to me as being his beau-ideal of a really\noutstanding story. So let me lie low. I have spoken out my literary\nheart to you, as any man, on occasion, should have the courage to do. But now let me lie low. For by what standards am I judging, after all,\nwho have only spent an hour in Chicago, and never a moment east of Suez? You will remember Morris, whom you met here during his last visit to\nEngland. And as you remember him so he is, with perhaps an added grey\nhair or two in his moustache, and a few more upon his temples. For the\nrest, he is just as lean and brown and boyish as he has always been, and\nwith a touch of deference in his first greetings to Esther and me that\nhas survived from the school-days, when he was a comparative nipper, and\nthat he will carry, I suppose, since he is English of the English, until\ncommon earth shall level us all. He was looking, when he first came in,\nrather hesitating and ill at ease, with his title, as it were, tucked\nawkwardly under his arm. Much like this I have seen him at school, on\nsome Old Boys' Day, coming back to the pavilion after making his\ncentury, with an uncomfortable shove at his cap, and something about the\nbowlers having been \"dead off their luck.\"\n\nFinding us alone however, and not disposed to worry him, he cheered up\namazingly, and was soon chattering to us briskly about his various\nadventures. His personal part in these would seem as a rule to have been\nconspicuous by its dullness; but the adventures themselves were well\nworth hearing about. And it was only quite accidentally, as he was\nleaving for Stoke, that we discovered him to be seconded for some\nspecial duties in the colonies--\"imperial defence, don't you know, and\nall that sort of thing; rather an interesting job.\"\n\nAnd did I tell you, by the way, that the Poles have bequeathed us their\nbaby during their visit to Italy?",

    "text": "XXVI\n\n_To John Summers, M.B., c/o the Rev. W. B. La Touche, High Barn,\nWinchester._\n\n 91B HARLEY STREET, W.,\n _October_ 18, 1910. MY DEAR JACK,\n\nI have just received your letter, and also the accountant's statement as\nregards Dr. Singleton's books; and I have instructed the solicitors to\nsell out enough of your stock to buy the quarter-share of his practice\nupon which you and he have agreed. If you can manage to obtain with it\nan equal proportion of his skill, kindliness, and cheerful adequacy you\nmay be quite sure that the advantage of the bargain will not be\naltogether upon his side. For though books are important of course, if\nthe man who keeps them is sound you needn't trouble your head so very\nmuch about them. And Singleton is sound through and through--not exactly\none of those brilliant men, perhaps, of whom, as operating surgeons, Sir\nFrederick Treves has declared himself to be so justly timid, but what\nis far better, one of those level-headed, big-hearted general\npractitioners, tender of hand and essentially careful, in whose\nprofessional history mistakes have been, and will continue to be,\npractically unknown. Moreover he was never, even as a student, one of those people who have\nset out to purchase skill in their own profession by the sacrifice of\nvery nearly every other human interest. _Nihil humani a me alienum puto_\nhas been his own as well as his hospital's motto. And you must some day\nget him to tell you the story of how an odd little insight into esoteric\nBuddhism that he was once curious enough to obtain became the means of\nsaving the life, to say nothing of the sanity, of one of the most\nvaluable men of our time. That late cut of his, too, is still well worth\nseeing; and there are not many of my friends who can go straighter to\nthe heart of a book or a picture--that is, if the book or the picture\nhas a heart to be got to. He may not be able to excise a Gasserian ganglion, or know very much\nabout the researches of Calmette or von Pircquet. But he knows precisely\nwhen to call in the men who do. And he's just the sort of assistant with\nwhom they feel safe in setting out to work. While, on the other hand,\nupon a hundred points--little everyday problems of medical practice,\nunclassified ailments that have never got into the text-books or been\ndignified with a Latin name, doubtful beginnings of more definite\nillnesses, their home-treatment, and the adequate settlement of the\ndomestic problems that they involve--there isn't a man in Harley Street\nwho could give a more valuable opinion. And he has performed a\ntracheotomy with his pocket-knife and a hair-pin, five miles from\nanywhere, in the heart of the Hampshire downs. Such men are not only the pillars of our profession, but its topmost\npinnacles, even if the wreaths and the knighthoods but seldom come their\nway. I am saying all this because I think that I can detect in your\nletter, and certainly in the newer generation of qualifying students, a\nkind of reluctance about going into general practice, as if this were in\na way an admission of failure, a sort of _dernier ressort_. Whereas of\ncourse there is no point of view from which such a way of looking at it\nis at all justifiable. General practice is at least as difficult, if it\nis to be carried on well and successfully, as any special practice can\nbe, and probably more so; for the G.P. has to live continually, as it\nwere, with the results of his handiwork. He is always liable to meet his\nfailures round the next corner; and his mistakes may quite easily rent\nthe pew behind him in the parish church. The consultant, on the other\nhand, comes into the family life from afar, and returns again, an hour\nor two later, to the seclusion of his private fastness. He has brought\ndown his little bit of extra technical skill or knowledge. He has used\nit for good or ill. And the results do not follow him, save indirectly,\nand at a very comfortable distance. But the G.P. who has taken upon\nhimself the responsibility of calling him in must needs still bear upon\nhis shoulders not only the anxiety that heralds ultimate success, but a\nlarge share of the possible obloquy that may follow failure. Moreover, in all the hundred extraneous interests that are involved, his\nadvice becomes of paramount importance. This would be the best room for\nthe patient from the point of view of quietness and aspect. But that, on\nthe other hand, is the room that he has been used to. His favourite\nbooks and pictures surround him there in the old accustomed order. Does\nthe doctor think it better for him to be moved? His wife, his mother,\nor his sister are anxious to nurse him.

And here is a\nservant-maid in the surgery with a throat that looks as diphtheritic as\na throat can well be; and she comes from a dairy farm that supplies half\nthe town with milk, under the eyes of a government inspector; while the\nrector's wife, nervous, and uncomfortably near forty, is expecting her\nfirst, long-looked-for baby some time this afternoon. It may take a good man to remove successfully an adherent appendix or\nan obscure tumour of the brain, or to diagnose some out-of-the-way\nlesion of a heart valve. But such a man, after all, has spent the\ngreater portion of his professional life in dealing with no other\nsubjects but these. And it must surely require at least an equal\nequipment, after its own kind, to deal wisely and rapidly with such\nvariously conflicting problems as I have just been describing. You are probably becoming a little bored by these commonplace remarks of\nmine. But they are the sort of truism that will generally bear an\noccasional reconsideration. And if I have a very private opinion, to\nwhich you cannot subscribe, that the really able general practitioner is\nperhaps the very best man in our ranks bar none, I am quite willing to\nconcede this extra superiority if you will grant him at least an equal\neminence to that of Sir Grosvenor le Draughte, as Mr. Russell has called\nhim in one of his recent books. So go into your practice with a good heart. Your experience as a locum\nin Bristol and Shropshire will have prepared you for any little\nmortifications that may be in waiting during your first few months. You\nwill be used to the disheartening fall of the countenance that greets\nthe junior partner when his senior was expected. And you will accept\nwith a grave countenance and an inward chuckle your knowledge of the\nextremely frank criticism that is likely to herald and succeed your\nfirst few visits. Even now there's a letter upon my desk from a\ndisrespectful young lady who shall be nameless. A new curate has made\nhis initial appearance in an Eastbourne drawing-room. \"He shook hands\njust like a baby,\" she writes, \"and he stopped to tea, and he sprawled\nall over the table, and he has quite nice eyes, but his mouth is just\nlike cook's when she's having one of her windy spasums.\" And if sixteen\ncan rise to heights like this, what about eighteen and twenty and\ntwenty-two? Nor are curates, alas, the only legitimate prey. I wonder if\nthere's a girls' school in your practice? You may lament too, for a little while perhaps, the slow dawning of\nconfidence in your new patients. But before very long you may even be\nrather overwhelmed (quite privately of course) by the freedom and\ncompleteness with which it is accorded you. And above all things, be\njust your natural self in dealing with them, forgetting, if you can,\nthat you have ever even heard of such an attribute as a good bedside\nmanner. This reminds me that only last week, in a railway carriage, I overheard\ntwo young ladies discussing a very sympathetic physician well known to\nus both. One of them was wondering why he had always been so successful. \"Oh, that,\" said the other cheerfully, \"is because he's so frightfully\ngood at comforting the relatives--_afterwards_, you know.\"\n\nIf your news must be bad, tell it soberly and promptly. It's\nseldom--very seldom--wise to conceal it for some dubious temporary\nbenefit. And if you are in doubt about any of their maladies let them\nknow it quite frankly, explaining to them in language suited to their\ndegree of education and intelligence exactly why this should be the\ncase. There's been a good deal written lately about the personal factor in\ntreatment, the Psychology of the Physician, and the mental therapeutics\nat his command. And I even saw a letter in the \"Lancet,\" a few weeks\nago, urging that the practical application of Personality in the\nsick-room should form one of the recognised subjects of the medical\ncurriculum. But in the first place, I'm exceedingly doubtful if the\nmodesty of our profession is so excessively marked as to demand for its\ncorrection a course of instruction in the conscious prescribing of its\nown personality. And in the second, I fail to see how this latter could\never be done without, by the very act, considerably altering that\nuncertain quantity, at any rate so far as its victim was concerned. And\nwhat would one's _ego_ be like, I wonder, after ten years' conscientious\nlabour? So I shouldn't worry too much about your personality if I were\nyou. It will be a good thing, no doubt, to get all you can into it by\nencouraging such tentacles as it may put forth to the sun and the\nbreeze.",

But what other people are to get out of it is a matter with\nwhich you may quite properly, I think, be too busy to concern yourself. While I'm still in the pulpit, let me recommend you to husband your\nenergies. Don't play tennis all the afternoon (even with Amaryllis) if\nyou have been up all night. Go to sleep in the hammock, instead, over a\nbook or a paper or a letter from Uncle Peter. And don't forget sometimes\nto say your prayers. For whatever may be one's private notions as to\ntheir ultimate Destination; whether one affects a belief in some\nbeneficent Overlord, once incarnate; or regards God as the ever-growing\nsum of all higher human volitions; or, remembering this infinitesimal\nparticle of earth in the greatness of the universe, considers such a\nconception to be inadequate; or admits only some possible\nStarting-point, a kind of Divine Convenience upon which to found\ntheories; or has never thought about the matter at all--it's always a\ngracious and comforting act to remove one's moral hat, as it were (even\nif reverence goes no further) to Something at any rate bigger than most\nof us. While even on the very chilliest of auto-suggestion grounds there\nis still a word to be said for it as a vehicle wherein to despatch one's\nextra troubles to some handy mental cemetery. For prayer, whether we\nlook upon it as sacred or superstitious, must still, as the hymn says,\nbe the soul's sincere desire, uttered or unexpressed. And occasional\nexpression is about as valuable a prelude to the acquiring of knowledge\nas any that are going. So I may as well tell you at once that I know nothing whatever about\nmotor-cars, and therefore find the last half of your letter entirely\nunintelligible. But I gather that the one you mean to purchase combines\nspeed, silence, and freedom from odour in a quite unusual degree. Some\nday, no doubt, I shall be sponging upon you for a lesson in driving\nit--or him--or do you call the thing her? Yr. affect. uncle,\n PETER HARDING.",

    "text": "XXVII\n\n_To Miss Sarah Harding, The Orphanage, Little Blessington, Dorset._\n\n 91B HARLEY STREET, W.,\n _November_ 7, 1910. MY DEAR SALLY,\n\nThis is going to be a short letter because the news that it contains is\nprobably speeding to you already--from Esther, to whom its greatness is\nnot unmixed with tears; and from Molly, to whom its joy is of the\neternal gold. Ten days ago she came back to us from Stoke, where, as she\ntold us, she had been having a good time, but seemed now to have\nfulfilled her little contract. For the house-party had broken up: Horace\nhad long ago made a late return to Cambridge; Carthew was in the Temple,\nand Pole in Fleet Street; Hilary and Norah were off to Spain; and the\none or two extra guns, just leisurely shooting men, had betaken\nthemselves, at any rate superficially regretful, to other people's\nhouses. Lady Wroxton was better--very nearly her old self, and for the\nmoment wrapped up, heart and soul, in her nephew Rupert. It had been a\npleasant visit. She kissed us very tenderly. And now it was high time\nthat she was back again among her girls at Hoxton. Two days later came a wire from Rupert asking if he might spend a night\nwith us on his way to Yorkshire. And in the evening he duly arrived. Nobody else was dining with us that night, and our little party at the\ntable was perhaps quieter than usual. After dinner we were going to\nsmoke our pipes in the library with Esther and Molly, when Rupert drew\nme aside and asked me to take him into the consulting-room. \"I want you just to run over me,\" he said, with his eyes on a dangling\nstethoscope, \"to run over me rather thoroughly.\"\n\nI glanced at him anxiously. But in his evening clothes he seemed even\nlither and more bronzed than ever. \"Feeling bad anywhere?\" I inquired. But he shook his head. \"Rather fit,\" he admitted, as he took off his coat and waistcoat. And as\nI suspected, I could find nothing wrong with him. On the contrary, he\nappeared to be in the very pink of condition, for all his tropical\nsojournings. \"Good,\" he said; \"and, as a matter of fact, I saw Manson this morning,\nand West this afternoon, and they both told me the same thing.\"\n\nI began to laugh at him, though he was speaking very seriously. \"You're\nsurely not becoming a hypochondriac?\" I asked. \"No,\" he said gravely; \"I don't think so. But I'm forty-seven, you see. And I want to get married.\"\n\nI was, perhaps, rather taken aback at this, though I scarcely knew why. And he himself appeared to consider the idea as savouring somewhat of\npresumption. For he blushed a little as he slowly collected his clothes. Somehow we had neither of us thought of him as being a marrying man. Then, as he began to dress himself again, I congratulated him, and asked\nhim if the lady was known to me. He hesitated for a moment, and then\nsmiled. \"Yes, I think she is,\" he said; \"though I doubt if you'd consider me\nmuch of a husband for her.\"\n\nHe filled his pipe thoughtfully. \"For though in some ways she seems to me to be rather old for her\nyears--old-fashioned, you know, and womanly, and all that--she's really\nrather young.\"\n\nHe seemed to consider this a difficulty. Then he looked at me with a\nkind of deprecating straightness. \"You'd be giving her,\" he said, \"to a fellow who's old enough to be her\nfather.\"\n\nI suppose that I looked a little surprised. \"Yes, I do,\" he said humbly; \"I mean Molly.\"\n\nWe sucked our pipes in silence for a minute or two, looking at one\nanother through the tobacco smoke. Then I asked him if he had ever\npointed out to Molly her striking lack of modernity. He shook his head. \"Hadn't the pluck,\" he confessed; \"but it's so obvious, isn't it?\"\n\nHe glanced at me anxiously. \"But you mustn't think I'm against it,\" he said. \"It's so rare nowadays. And I think it's beautiful; and anyway, it's just what I've been wanting\nall my life.\"\n\n\"You'll let me talk to Esther?\" I asked presently. \"I should like to talk to her myself,\" he answered, \"only I'm such a\nfool at these things.\"\n\nHe lit another match. \"Look here,\" he went on, \"I don't want you to tell me what you both\nthink for a week--till I come back from Yorkshire. I'm too old for her,\nI know. But I seem to be pretty sound, and I--well, dash it all, Peter,\nyou know her better than I do, although you--d'you know, by the way,\nthat you rather put me off her in that last letter of yours?\"\n\n\"Did I?\" I asked. \"Perhaps that was because I don't really know her so\nwell.\"\n\n\"Well, first,\" he said, \"there was that Lynn affair, of course. But\nthat's dead, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Quite,\" I told him; \"and they've both gone out of mourning.\"\n\n\"And then,\" he went on, \"you made me think of a rather up-to-date young\nwoman, quite nice, of course,\" he looked at me apologetically, \"but\nperhaps just a little bit self-complacent. Whereas I found in her,\ninstead, everything that I've always worshipped most, you know--from\nrather a long way off.\"\n\n * * * * *\n\nThat was a week ago. And since he left, as you will imagine, both Esther\nand I have done a good deal of thinking. For on the one side we\ncouldn't help feeling the absurdity of regarding Rupert as a son-in-law. And on the other we should be giving our daughter--or rather watching\nher go--into the hands of one of our oldest friends. Given love too, how\nwell should they be mated; both so strong, but he so abidingly simple,\nso unchallenged by surrounding mysteries, and she so eager, so\ndelicately tuned to each passing subtlety of thought.",

Characteristically enough, he had neither told us, before he went, how\nclearly he had shown Molly his feelings, nor asked us to discuss with\nher, or to withhold, his announcement to ourselves. And so we said\nnothing to her about it. But just now, as we were expecting his arrival,\nI discovered, I think, that our desire for her had been fulfilled. For\nwith a shyness bringing back to me a little girl that I had forgotten,\nshe had perched herself on the arm of my chair; so that when his voice\nwas in the hall there wasn't very far to bend. \"You told me to wait for Heaven, you know,\" she reminded me. And her\neyes confessed that it was standing at the door. Your affect. brother,\n PETER. P.S.--I can see you pursing those wise lips of yours, and muttering that\nHeaven has been a little sudden.

MY DEAR AUNT JOSEPHINE,\n\nWe shall be very disappointed if you don't come to Molly's wedding,\nalthough it is to be rather a quiet one, or at any rate as quiet as we\ncan manage to keep it--not because we are anything but desirous that as\nmany people as are kind enough to do so may rejoice with us over the\noccasion; but because, from Molly downwards, we have a temperamental\nshrinking from crowded churches, pavement druggets, hired exotics, and\npaid choir-boys.

And we all\nthink the old bracelet that you have sent to Molly very beautiful. Both\nof them will so much want to thank you personally for your gifts that\nyou must really make up your mind, I think, to take the risks of the\njourney (the most recent statistics show these to be quite small) and\nstay with us here for a couple of nights from December 6th.

    "text": "XXIX\n\n_To the Rev. Bruce Harding, S. Peter's College, Morecambe Bay._\n\n 91B HARLEY STREET, W.,\n _December_ 2, 1910. MY DEAR BRUCE,\n\nIt was very good of you to enclose a note in your letter to Molly, and\nthe more so because I have an uncomfortable suspicion that I may have\nwounded you a little when I wrote to you last. If only we could use\ncolours now, to express our deeper attitude on these occasions--as some\nof your fellow-clergy wear stoles at certain seasons--with what pleasant\nimpunity could we write to one another in yellow, or purple, or red,\nleaving black for the editor of \"The Times,\" or the plumber whose bill\nwe're disputing. But, alas, even our lightest thoughts must needs go\nforth clad like mutes at a funeral, and dependent upon those who meet\nthem to detect their forlorn humanity. And so if I have talked, as the\noutsider that I am, too harshly of things that are dear to you, you\nmust forgive me even as Merridew has forgiven Rogers. For you know--why should I tell you?--that it was no Word from on high\nthat my puny humanity was attempting to challenge, but only the chains\n(as they seem to me) of Its ecclesiastical exposition; as though man had\nbeen made for the Church, and not the Church for man. And yet even thus\none can only bow before its achievement. For to be able, as the miner of\nwhom we read the other day, to sing \"Lead, kindly Light\" through the\nfoul air of some blocked-up coal-pit is better than to have all\nknowledge--and an abundant justification of any creed that makes it\npossible. \"Thou wouldst not seek Me,\" says the Saviour in the \"Mirror of Jesus,\"\n\"if thou hadst not found Me.\"\n\nDo you know the quotation? I came upon it by chance the other day as\nrepeated by Bourget in a book that I happened to be reading. And it\nseems to me to contain very simply--if only we might give it something\nmore than an academic consent--just the one conception that is needed\nfor the true and permanent sweetening of all our religious\nrelationships. For they _are_ seeking, these pig-headed people who annoy\nus so much--I think that, nowadays, we most of us can admit as much as\nthat. Methodist, Sacerdotalist, Hyde-Park Agnostic, Christian Socialist,\nRoman Modernist, Traditional Romanist, High, Low, Broad, Middle, Open,\nClosed (I wonder if God laughs sometimes at our resounding definitions),\nor Free Lance--we cannot help pitying them, of course, according to our\nseveral lights; but in so far as their sincerity is manifest, we do\nbehold in them the signs of a mistaken search. And yet, by that very fact, have they not really found? Not our\nparticular little glimpse of the Almighty and the Eternal, but some\nother little glimpse--something, at any rate, that is evidently making\nthem strive for more; and something that they, like we, are desperately\nanxious to share. Or why these dusts of conflict? And yet, perhaps, the dusts are inevitable, after all--the surest sign\nthat the Building grows beneath its million workers, and that the\nmallets and chisels are being busy against that great day of Affirmation\nwhen the Temple shall stand complete at the meeting-place of all our\nroads. And meanwhile Molly and Rupert, at any rate, are feeling very\nhappy--with a proud humility, carefully concealed. His years have\nseldom weighed heavily on Molly's future husband, though as a matter of\nbald fact he is Mr. Pickwick's senior. And lately he has been dropping\nthem by handfuls. Molly, however, must have picked some of them up, I\nfancy, and is wearing them with an appropriate dignity. Your affect. cousin,\n PETER HARDING.",

    "text": "XXX\n\n_To Hugh Pontrex, Villa Rosa, Mentone._\n\n 91B HARLEY STREET, W.,\n _December_ 25, 1910,\n 10.30 p.m. MY DEAR HUGH,\n\nThis seems an odd sort of time at which to begin a letter--even to you. But this has been an odd sort of Christmas, a kind of aftermath, as far\nas its festivities have been concerned, of those demanded by Molly's\nmarriage. The two water-colours that you sent them, by the way, were\nboth lovely, quite in your happiest vein; and I am sorry that at present\nthey have no permanent wall to hang them on. But Rupert's colonial tour,\nupon which they had to start early last week, will scarcely be finished,\nI suppose, for twelve months; and even then their place of habitation\nseems likely to be very movable. So, upon the whole, we have been a\nquiet little party, or as quiet, at any rate, as Claire and Tom will\nallow; and we decided to spend the afternoon at the hospital, which is\n_en f\u00eate_ for some twenty-four hours, at the price, possibly, of a few\nsubsequent temperatures, but to the immediate benediction of all\nconcerned. Have you ever been to the hospital? I think not. And I daren't attempt\nto describe it to you, chiefly, I suppose, on account of the natural\nreticence, the _mauvaise bonte_, or the golden silence--I leave you to\nselect--with which most men avoid such subjects as their wives, their\nsouls, and their _alma mater_; but secondarily because, by the time my\nletter reached you, the description would most probably have ceased to\nbe true. It would have added a storey, or sprouted a wing. Let me\ncontent myself therefore with pointing out to you those two boys\nstanding rather awkwardly in one corner of the entrance-hall--the\nleft-hand corner between the cloak-room and the porter's desk. Both of\nthem have only just left school. The shiny-haired one, with the crimson\ntie, and the gold buttons on his waistcoat, and the creases on his\nrather striking trousers, was at one of our older foundations. The\nother, with yesterday's collar round his neck, and a stain or two of\nnitric acid upon his sleeves, has just won an entrance scholarship from\na private school at Camberwell. The second is the shyer of the two\nperhaps, in spite of his ardent Fabianism and his bitter independence\nof revealed religion. But both are a little nervous in that they are\nonly in their first year, and still, academically speaking, confined to\nthe study of the dog-fish in a remoter corner of the college. They are\nfeeling rather young, in fact, though the hospital's name is on their\nvisiting cards--something like new boys again, at the bottom of the\nfirst form. Three Christmases from now, however, and they will be sauntering here\nvery much at their ease, waiting about with their house-physicians for\nthe two o'clock arrival of their chiefs from Harley Street. The gold\nbuttons will have disappeared, I think, by then, and the trousers will\nbe modester in hue; while on the other hand that collar will be above\nsuspicion, and you might search in vain for a trace of red corrosive. Both, too, will be dangling stethoscopes, and would like, if they were\nquite certain of the chairman, to be smoking a Virginian cigarette. In\nother words, they have deserted the college for the \"house.\" They have\nbecome critics of the nursing staff, and their talk--not on Christmas\nDay, of course--is of _r\u00e2les_ and _rhonchi_ and the merits of their\nrespective H.P.'s. There are some of them standing about in the hall as\nour party dismounts from the carriage. But the majority are already in\ntheir favourite wards, whose walls they have been helping to decorate. Far removed are they from the Sawyers of yesterday, though at times they\ngrow merry with wine. For the demands of examiners have become annually\nmore stringent; their hospital duties are arduous; and hard work, as\neverybody knows, is the next-door neighbour to virtue. Give them but three Christmases more, and they will be even as this\nwhite-coated and dignified young man whom Horace and I are watching as\nhe deals with the patients in the receiving-room. For these will drift\nin from the streets and tenements, whether or no the day be a Festival,\nand partly, perhaps, with an eye to possible good cheer. We wait a\nlittle, as he stands there by the pillar, a curious contrast, with his\nfresh face and athletic figure, to the slouching fleshiness of these big\nnavvies and the stunted urbanity of the rest. Behind him stand a couple of dressers, fresh from the college, willing,\nbut still perhaps a little bewildered, and to whom this all-knowing and\nself-possessed young surgeon is something of a god. His treatment is\nrapid--it has to be--for he is here primarily to sort out the cases\nthat come crowding in their daily hundreds. But he must never make a\nmistake--a grave one, that is. And the remembrance of this has taught\nhim--no easy matter--to know real illness when he sees it with a pretty\nhigh degree of certainty. So the bad cases he sets on one side. For if\npossible they must be admitted; and at any rate they must be seen by the\nhouse-surgeon or house-physician on duty. While as for the rest, they\nmay be given at once the necessary pill, or a desirable draught from\nthat decorated urn in the corner--there's a certain irony in that\nparticular wreath of holly--or despatched, with out-patient cards, to\nappropriate special departments. And all this time there is flowing from him to the dressers a little\nstream of wounds to be stitched, torn scalps to be cleaned, and sprains\nand strains to be temporarily bandaged. Odder things too may be\ndemanding their youthful attention. Here, for instance, is a genial but,\nalas, beery Irishwoman of vast _embonpoint_, whose wedding-ring has been\njammed into her finger, and must at all costs be removed.",

And the remembrance of this has taught\nhim--no easy matter--to know real illness when he sees it with a pretty\nhigh degree of certainty. So the bad cases he sets on one side. For if\npossible they must be admitted; and at any rate they must be seen by the\nhouse-surgeon or house-physician on duty. While as for the rest, they\nmay be given at once the necessary pill, or a desirable draught from\nthat decorated urn in the corner--there's a certain irony in that\nparticular wreath of holly--or despatched, with out-patient cards, to\nappropriate special departments. And all this time there is flowing from him to the dressers a little\nstream of wounds to be stitched, torn scalps to be cleaned, and sprains\nand strains to be temporarily bandaged. Odder things too may be\ndemanding their youthful attention. Here, for instance, is a genial but,\nalas, beery Irishwoman of vast _embonpoint_, whose wedding-ring has been\njammed into her finger, and must at all costs be removed. Alcoholic\ninvocations are breathed into the dresser's ear as he files patiently at\nthis brass emblem of married unity. Sure, darlin', she tells him, if\nshe could only be rid of her ould man as aisy, she'd be another woman\nto-morrer, she would. While here, sitting next her, is a dark-eyed\ntwelve-year-old, holding out a pathetic little toe that has been stamped\nupon by a passing dray-horse. It is attached to a very grimy foot that\nwas not, one fears, the only inhabitant of the stocking that contained\nit. And the dresser is not sure if the bone is broken. She has the\ncountenance of a tear-stained Madonna; but her language, when he twists\nher toe, becomes positively lurid. The other women titter or are\nshocked, the Sister rebukes her, and young white-coat is called up for\nreference. He likes the little girl, and gives her some chocolate,\nwhereupon she stifles half her sobs and most of her profanity. Yes, it's\na fracture all right. Does the dresser know how to put on a poroplastic\nsplint? The dresser looks a little uncertain. So white-coat gives him a\nswiftly helping hand, and within five minutes is removing a decayed\nSemitic molar that has been giving its owner _schmerz_ indescribable. Accompanying this gentleman are his two sisters, a married brother with\nhis wife and family, and an elderly uncle, all of whom wail\nincontinently to the general discomfort. Glancing over his shoulder,\nyoung white-coat sends briefly for a porter, who courteously removes\nthem; and is only just in time, having extracted the tooth successfully,\nto avoid the happy sufferer's embraces. He has never hurried; and yet by\nthe time that we have made our round of the dressing-rooms the benches\nare empty, and he has disappeared to his pipe and his arm-chair. Can you\nbelieve that but four years ago he was throwing chalk about the\ndissecting-room, and stamping uproariously during lectures? This wonder has my hospital performed. And what am I to tell you of the\nSister who has witnessed it--whose shrewd eyes have beheld so many\ndressers emerging rawly from the college or from Cambridge, becoming in\ndue time even as our white-clad friend, and passing hence, as he will\npass, into the staid gravity of the family doctor? There's a time--fortunately brief--in the career of the just-qualified\nstudent when he is a little inclined to assert his professional\nsupremacy. How tenderly she watches him through it; and how, telling him\nall things, she apparently tells him nothing! I wouldn't like to say how\nmany years she has stood there, or what sights, humorous, tragic,\nunpaintably indecent, she has witnessed in all that time. And you could\ncertainly never guess them for yourself. Let me only say then that her\nwisdom is more than the wisdom of many physicians, and that no gentler\nfingers have touched the seamy side of life. And yet, I suppose, she was once a little girl, shinning up the orchard\ntrees for the apples at the top. And she can still, I believe, drop a\nsentimental tear or two upon the last page of a novel. So can this be\nyet another miracle that my hospital has wrought? Dear me--and we have\ngot no further than the receiving-room, and scarcely even thought about\nthe patients. Sometimes I wonder if the people whose pennies are invited to keep us\nfor a second ever realise the full significance of the instant that they\nmake their own. Not always, I think, for even I, who am in the hospital\nthree times a week, only get an occasional vision of it--chiefly on such\ndays as these, when one may travel its wards at large, unforbidden by\nprofessional etiquette. Do they know, for example, that under the roof\nof the out-patients' department there are two small boys--open-mouthed\nlittle snorers of yesterday, sprawling about on the pavement inviting\ntrouble--whose tonsils during that moment have been successfully removed\nfrom them? And can they perceive, in the same measure of time, a dozen\nblocked-up ears and noses being skilfully examined by electrical\nillumination? Do they realise that, simultaneously with all this, eight\nshort-sighted persons are being tested for spectacles, and two more\nbeing operated upon for squint; that three men with diseased skins are\nbeing prescribed for in another part of the building, and that four\nwomen who were being consumed with lupus are now being cured with light;\nthat a poor servant-girl is under gas while her yet poorer teeth are\nbeing removed, and that three others are being fitted with nerveless new\nones; that a little damsel with a dislocated hip is having it put in\nplaster; that an elderly and rheumatic cab-driver is being helped with\nradiant heat; and that some four hundred men and women of all\ndescriptions are waiting their turn for treatment?",

My numbers are\nconservative; but, even so, does the gentleman on the underground\nrailway platform realise (to be merely sordid) that during his second\nsome five hundred pounds' worth of free operations are in progress? Does\nhe visualise the resultant satisfaction in all those squalid little\nhomes, the domestic relief, the returning efficiency, the rolled-away\nanxiety, the dawning happiness? And does he remember that he has as yet\npeeped into but one department of the great hospital that he is\nsupporting? But really, on a Christmas Day one shouldn't be thinking about these\nthings; and you must put them down to an elderly garrulity, or as being,\nif you will, in the nature of a half-sorrowful farewell. For by next\nChristmas, alas, my wards will have ceased to know me. The twenty years'\nspan allotted to me will have come to its close; and even to-day, at a\ncorner of the corridor, I overheard a hazarded guess at my successor. So after a long pilgrimage through gay and chattering wards--they were\nall gay this afternoon, only you mustn't look, perhaps, at those quiet\ncorners--we at last found Esther and her party in the gayest of them\nall. I will call it this, as being a very complete disguise if you\nshould ever quote me to the Sister of another. And here a troupe of\nresidents was delivering a little series of songs and dances, to the\ncomplete delight of some forty patients and a background of visitors and\nnurses. Its members were particularly hilarious. I fancy indeed that\nthey must have primed themselves with a little previous champagne--a\nvery little, and you must remember that at least two of them had been up\nfor most of the night. But nobody noticed this; and Claire, at any rate,\nwas very thoroughly taken by storm. \"Won't they come back presently?\" she asked. But the Sister shook her head. If Claire wanted to see them again she\nmust go off to some other ward. I saw her turn to Tom. \"Shall we?\" she said, and they slipped away together. But before they\nwent I heard her calling his particular attention to one of the players,\n\"the second from the left,\" she whispered, \"the awfully handsome one\"--a\nnew note for Claire? Yes, just a little new. And so we left it at last, driving out into the street through a small\ncrowd of eager, white-faced children, for some of whom, no doubt, its\nwalls were as the walls of Paradise. It was quite dark, with a blur of\nrain upon the carriage windows; and for a minute or two the hospital,\nwith its long rows of lighted wards, towered dimly upon our left. \"Just like a great big liner,\" said Claire, who had been down to\nSouthampton when Molly and Rupert sailed. And so indeed one could\nimagine it--lifting its strong sides above all these crowded roof-tops,\nwith unshaken bows, and Hope upon the bridge, and Comfort, at least, to\nminister in its cabins. \"And yet there's something awful in it too,\" said Jeanie Graham. \"Chiefly,\" explained Horace philosophically, \"because we're going home\nourselves to an excellent Christmas dinner.\"\n\n\"And happen to be feeling rather well,\" said Esther. \"And partly, I suppose,\" added Jeanie, \"because just now we're looking\nat it from the outside.\"\n\n\"And a little bit,\" I guessed, \"because it stands, in a sense, for\nKnowledge with a big K. And there are times when we're all rather afraid\nof that--even when it wants to do us good.\"\n\n\"But we run to it in the end,\" smiled Jeanie. Let me introduce you to her as she sits opposite to me in the\nbrougham--or to so much of her as is not obscured by Claire, who is\ndividing her weight between Horace and his wife-apparent. Strictly\nspeaking, I suppose, she is scarcely to be described as pretty. Her\ncheek-bones are the least shade too high, and her eyebrows just a trifle\ntoo level. Here and there too her skin, still clinging to its Highland\nbrown, is powdered with tiny freckles; and though her nose is straight\nenough, a purist might consider her mouth too big, and her chin perhaps\na little too firm--but very pleasantly so. Her hair is dark and wavy,\nand in its natural setting--a grey tam-'o-shanter, I think, and the tail\nof a Scotch mist--might well contain the deep, divine, dark dayshine of\nthe poet. And indeed I have been assured that it does. I have left her\neyes to the last, because at present she is standing away from them a\nlittle. Regarded as mere windows to her mind they are well opened,\nclear, and grey. But Horace, who has seen their owner leaning out of\nthem, could no doubt describe them better. And we think that he's a\nfortunate young man. Our only other guest was Wensley, dragged reluctantly from Chelsea.",

And we think that he's a\nfortunate young man. Our only other guest was Wensley, dragged reluctantly from Chelsea. His\nyear has had some of its usual disappointments. His big work wasn't\nfinished in time for the Academy, and is still in his studio. But though\nthe Chantrey trustees passed over the very beautiful bronze that he did\nsend, he has sold this to the National Gallery at Copenhagen for six\nhundred pounds, and has spent, in consequence, a fortnight at\nWhitby--his first holiday, I believe, in three years, since his invalid\naunt and sister absorb most of his usual earnings. He always looks odd\nand uncomfortable in evening dress. But our very informal table\ngenerally sets him at his ease. And he is an extreme favourite with both\nTom and Claire. To-night he remembered one of Tom's songs, and persuaded\nhim, after dinner, to deliver it--with a little hesitation at first (for\nthe poor boy has still got some scruples, I think), but ultimately to\nhis saving grace. He left us at ten o'clock, for the invalids' sake, by\nwhich time Tom and Claire announced themselves to be feeling rather\nsleepy, without, as I observed, any notable protest from Jeanie and\nHorace. So they have both gone upstairs to bed; or at least I had\nthought so. But a tentative whisper at my door-handle has aroused my\nsuspicions. I am busy writing to Mr. Pontrex, so that I shall be sure\nnot to hear anything; and slowly the crack widens between the door-edge\nand the architrave. Across the blackness disclosed, flashes the gleam of\na white-frocked arm, like a turning trout in a pool; and presently a\nbrown hand, desperately silent, begins feeling for my key. I look at it\napprehensively (for I have become a little nervous on this point lately)\nand am happily relieved to find it ringless. I must be very quick. * * * * *\n\nAnd yet, as you will have noticed, even Claire is growing up, still\nfaithful to a more boisterous March, but now and then holding out her\nfinger-tips to May. She reposes, as you may remember, in the little room\nnext to ours. And yesterday morning Esther called me from my\nshaving-glass. For she had opened the door between, to discover that\nClaire had flown. Whither we could guess very easily, as she was even\nthen hammering Tom with her pillow. But there, balanced face downwards\non the edge of the bolster, lay a momentarily forgotten photograph. Esther touched it with a smile. \"D'you think we ought to?\" she asked. And then she drew back. But at\nthat moment a rather more vehement bump than its predecessors shook the\nwall and floor so thoroughly that the photo slid down upon the sheets,\npoised itself for a second upon its edge, and then dropped over, to\nreveal the very debonair figure of Mr. George Alexander as the gallant\nRudolf Rassendyll. We looked at one another, and laughed--but only a\nlittle. And then Esther restored the picture to its resting-place. Some day we shall meet him in the Park, and Claire will behold a very\ngenial, middle-aged gentleman, a little inclined to be plump. But he\nwon't be Rudolf Rassendyll. And what will happen to his likeness? * * * * *\n\n\"She'll put it in her bottom drawer,\" smiles Esther, leaning over me as\nI write, \"and it'll become part of somebody else.\"\n\nShe drops a kiss upon my occiput. \"And now you must come to bed,\" she adds, \"or perhaps to-morrow morning\nyou'll be tired.\"\n\nAnd by this, of course, she means \"cross,\" though possibly, by some\nblessed dispensation, she imagines that she doesn't. For long (as I am\nminded to tell you, Hugh Pontrex), long before she's married, a woman\nhas made a garment for the man who is to wed her--a beautiful and rather\nprincely garment, and fortunately a bigger one than is usually required. Because then, you see, she has only to take a tuck in it--and forget\nabout it--and there's her man clad in his coat, just as she had always\ndreamed that he would come to her. Most women, I'm afraid, have to\ndeepen this tuck until there's no more stuff that they can turn. And by\nthat time, perhaps, we have begun to suspect that there has been some\ntampering with our property. \"D'you mean to say,\" we inquire bitterly, \"that we've grown out of it\nalready?\"\n\nAnd then it is that they must needs explain to us, with dewy eyes and\nhands upon our shoulders, how it's only the same dear garment\nstill--_three times as thick_. \"What nonsense,\" says Esther above my shoulder. \"The garment?\" I ask. \"No, the--the tuck.\"\n\nBut she looks a little conscious.

    "text": "Produced by Julie Barkley, Graeme Mackreth and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\nTHE BOOK OF THE DAMNED\n\n\nA procession of the damned. By the damned, I mean the excluded. We shall have a procession of data that Science has excluded. Battalions of the accursed, captained by pallid data that I have\nexhumed, will march. You'll read them--or they'll march. Some of them\nlivid and some of them fiery and some of them rotten. Some of them are corpses, skeletons, mummies, twitching, tottering,\nanimated by companions that have been damned alive. There are giants\nthat will walk by, though sound asleep. There are things that are\ntheorems and things that are rags: they'll go by like Euclid arm in arm\nwith the spirit of anarchy. Here and there will flit little harlots. Many are clowns. But many are of the highest respectability. Some are\nassassins. There are pale stenches and gaunt superstitions and mere\nshadows and lively malices: whims and amiabilities. The na\u00efve and the\npedantic and the bizarre and the grotesque and the sincere and the\ninsincere, the profound and the puerile. A stab and a laugh and the patiently folded hands of hopeless propriety. The ultra-respectable, but the condemned, anyway. The aggregate appearance is of dignity and dissoluteness: the aggregate\nvoice is a defiant prayer: but the spirit of the whole is processional. The power that has said to all these things that they are damned, is\nDogmatic Science. But they'll march. The little harlots will caper, and freaks will distract attention, and\nthe clowns will break the rhythm of the whole with their\nbuffooneries--but the solidity of the procession as a whole: the\nimpressiveness of things that pass and pass and pass, and keep on and\nkeep on and keep on coming. The irresistibleness of things that neither threaten nor jeer nor defy,\nbut arrange themselves in mass-formations that pass and pass and keep on\npassing. * * * * *\n\nSo, by the damned, I mean the excluded. But by the excluded I mean that which will some day be the excluding. Or everything that is, won't be. And everything that isn't, will be--\n\nBut, of course, will be that which won't be--\n\nIt is our expression that the flux between that which isn't and that\nwhich won't be, or the state that is commonly and absurdly called\n\"existence,\" is a rhythm of heavens and hells: that the damned won't\nstay damned; that salvation only precedes perdition. The inference is\nthat some day our accursed tatterdemalions will be sleek angels. Then\nthe sub-inference is that some later day, back they'll go whence they\ncame. * * * * *\n\nIt is our expression that nothing can attempt to be, except by\nattempting to exclude something else: that that which is commonly called\n\"being\" is a state that is wrought more or less definitely\nproportionately to the appearance of positive difference between that\nwhich is included and that which is excluded. But it is our expression that there are no positive differences: that\nall things are like a mouse and a bug in the heart of a cheese. Mouse\nand a bug: no two things could seem more unlike. They're there a week,\nor they stay there a month: both are then only transmutations of cheese. I think we're all bugs and mice, and are only different expressions of\nan all-inclusive cheese. Or that red is not positively different from yellow: is only another\ndegree of whatever vibrancy yellow is a degree of: that red and yellow\nare continuous, or that they merge in orange. So then that, if, upon the basis of yellowness and redness, Science\nshould attempt to classify all phenomena, including all red things as\nveritable, and excluding all yellow things as false or illusory, the\ndemarcation would have to be false and arbitrary, because things colored\norange, constituting continuity, would belong on both sides of the\nattempted borderline. As we go along, we shall be impressed with this:\n\nThat no basis for classification, or inclusion and exclusion, more\nreasonable than that of redness and yellowness has ever been conceived\nof. Science has, by appeal to various bases, included a multitude of data. Had it not done so, there would be nothing with which to seem to be. Science has, by appeal to various bases, excluded a multitude of data. Then, if redness is continuous with yellowness: if every basis of\nadmission is continuous with every basis of exclusion, Science must have\nexcluded some things that are continuous with the accepted. In redness\nand yellowness, which merge in orangeness, we typify all tests, all\nstandards, all means of forming an opinion--\n\nOr that any positive opinion upon any subject is illusion built upon the\nfallacy that there are positive differences to judge by--\n\nThat the quest of all intellection has been for something--a fact, a\nbasis, a generalization, law, formula, a major premise that is positive:\nthat the best that has ever been done has been to say that some things\nare self-evident--whereas, by evidence we mean the support of something\nelse--\n\nThat this is the quest; but that it has never been attained; but that\nScience has acted, ruled, pronounced, and condemned as if it had been\nattained. What is a house? It is not possible to say what anything is, as positively distinguished\nfrom anything else, if there are no positive differences. A barn is a house, if one lives in it. If residence constitutes\nhouseness, because style of architecture does not, then a bird's nest is\na house: and human occupancy is not the standard to judge by, because we\nspeak of dogs' houses; nor material, because we speak of snow houses of\nEskimos--or a shell is a house to a hermit crab--or was to the mollusk\nthat made it--or things seemingly so positively different as the White\nHouse at Washington and a shell on the seashore are seen to be\ncontinuous.",

So no one has ever been able to say what electricity is, for instance. It isn't anything, as positively distinguished from heat or magnetism or\nlife. Metaphysicians and theologians and biologists have tried to define\nlife. They have failed, because, in a positive sense, there is nothing\nto define: there is no phenomenon of life that is not, to some degree,\nmanifest in chemism, magnetism, astronomic motions. White coral islands in a dark blue sea. Their seeming of distinctness: the seeming of individuality, or of\npositive difference one from another--but all are only projections from\nthe same sea bottom. The difference between sea and land is not\npositive. In all water there is some earth: in all earth there is some\nwater. So then that all seeming things are not things at all, if all are\ninter-continuous, any more than is the leg of a table a thing in itself,\nif it is only a projection from something else: that not one of us is a\nreal person, if, physically, we're continuous with environment; if,\npsychically, there is nothing to us but expression of relation to\nenvironment. Our general expression has two aspects:\n\nConventional monism, or that all \"things\" that seem to have identity of\ntheir own are only islands that are projections from something\nunderlying, and have no real outlines of their own. But that all \"things,\" though only projections, are projections that are\nstriving to break away from the underlying that denies them identity of\ntheir own. I conceive of one inter-continuous nexus, in which and of which all\nseeming things are only different expressions, but in which all things\nare localizations of one attempt to break away and become real things,\nor to establish entity or positive difference or final demarcation or\nunmodified independence--or personality or soul, as it is called in\nhuman phenomena--\n\nThat anything that tries to establish itself as a real, or positive, or\nabsolute system, government, organization, self, soul, entity,\nindividuality, can so attempt only by drawing a line about itself, or\nabout the inclusions that constitute itself, and damning or excluding,\nor breaking away from, all other \"things\":\n\nThat, if it does not so act, it cannot seem to be;\n\nThat, if it does so act, it falsely and arbitrarily and futilely and\ndisastrously acts, just as would one who draws a circle in the sea,\nincluding a few waves, saying that the other waves, with which the\nincluded are continuous, are positively different, and stakes his life\nupon maintaining that the admitted and the damned are positively\ndifferent. Our expression is that our whole existence is animation of the local by\nan ideal that is realizable only in the universal:\n\nThat, if all exclusions are false, because always are included and\nexcluded continuous: that if all seeming of existence perceptible to us\nis the product of exclusion, there is nothing that is perceptible to us\nthat really is: that only the universal can really be. Our especial interest is in modern science as a manifestation of this\none ideal or purpose or process:\n\nThat it has falsely excluded, because there are no positive standards to\njudge by: that it has excluded things that, by its own pseudo-standards,\nhave as much right to come in as have the chosen. * * * * *\n\nOur general expression:\n\nThat the state that is commonly and absurdly called \"existence,\" is a\nflow, or a current, or an attempt, from negativeness to positiveness,\nand is intermediate to both. By positiveness we mean:\n\nHarmony, equilibrium, order, regularity, stability, consistency, unity,\nrealness, system, government, organization, liberty, independence, soul,\nself, personality, entity, individuality, truth, beauty, justice,\nperfection, definiteness--\n\nThat all that is called development, progress, or evolution is movement\ntoward, or attempt toward, this state for which, or for aspects of\nwhich, there are so many names, all of which are summed up in the one\nword \"positiveness.\"\n\nAt first this summing up may not be very readily acceptable. At first it\nmay seem that all these words are not synonyms: that \"harmony\" may mean\n\"order,\" but that by \"independence,\" for instance, we do not mean\n\"truth,\" or that by \"stability\" we do not mean \"beauty,\" or \"system,\" or\n\"justice.\"\n\nI conceive of one inter-continuous nexus, which expresses itself in\nastronomic phenomena, and chemic, biologic, psychic, sociologic: that it\nis everywhere striving to localize positiveness: that to this attempt in\nvarious fields of phenomena--which are only quasi-different--we give\ndifferent names. We speak of the \"system\" of the planets, and not of\ntheir \"government\": but in considering a store, for instance, and its\nmanagement, we see that the words are interchangeable. It used to be\ncustomary to speak of chemic equilibrium, but not of social equilibrium:\nthat false demarcation has been broken down. We shall see that by all\nthese words we mean the same state. As every-day conveniences, or in\nterms of common illusions, of course, they are not synonyms. To a child\nan earth worm is not an animal. It is to the biologist. By \"beauty,\" I mean that which seems complete. Obversely, that the incomplete, or the mutilated, is the ugly. Venus de Milo. To a child she is ugly. When a mind adjusts to thinking of her as a completeness, even though,\nby physiologic standards, incomplete, she is beautiful.",

Stability, too, then, can\nbe only the universal, or that besides which there is nothing else. Though some things seem to have--or have--higher approximations to\nstability than have others, there are, in our experience, only various\ndegrees of intermediateness to stability and instability. Every man,\nthen, who works for stability under its various names of \"permanency,\"\n\"survival,\" \"duration,\" is striving to localize in something the state\nthat is realizable only in the universal. By independence, entity, and individuality, I can mean only that\nbesides which there is nothing else, if given only two things, they must\nbe continuous and mutually affective, if everything is only a reaction\nto something else, and any two things would be destructive of each\nother's independence, entity, or individuality. All attempted organizations and systems and consistencies, some\napproximating far higher than others, but all only intermediate to Order\nand Disorder, fail eventually because of their relations with outside\nforces. All are attempted completenesses. If to all local phenomena\nthere are always outside forces, these attempts, too, are realizable\nonly in the state of completeness, or that to which there are no outside\nforces. Or that all these words are synonyms, all meaning the state that we call\nthe positive state--\n\nThat our whole \"existence\" is a striving for the positive state. The amazing paradox of it all:\n\nThat all things are trying to become the universal by excluding other\nthings. That there is only this one process, and that it does animate all\nexpressions, in all fields of phenomena, of that which we think of as\none inter-continuous nexus:\n\nThe religious and their idea or ideal of the soul. They mean distinct,\nstable entity, or a state that is independent, and not a mere flux of\nvibrations or complex of reactions to environment, continuous with\nenvironment, merging away with an infinitude of other interdependent\ncomplexes. But the only thing that would not merge away into something else would\nbe that besides which there is nothing else. That Truth is only another name for the positive state, or that the\nquest for Truth is the attempt to achieve positiveness:\n\nScientists who have thought that they were seeking Truth, but who were\ntrying to find out astronomic, or chemic, or biologic truths. But Truth\nis that besides which there is nothing: nothing to modify it, nothing to\nquestion it, nothing to form an exception: the all-inclusive, the\ncomplete--\n\nBy Truth I mean the Universal. So chemists have sought the true, or the real, and have always failed in\ntheir endeavors, because of the outside relations of chemical\nphenomena: have failed in the sense that never has a chemical law,\nwithout exceptions, been discovered: because chemistry is continuous\nwith astronomy, physics, biology--For instance, if the sun should\ngreatly change its distance from this earth, and if human life could\nsurvive, the familiar chemic formulas would no longer work out: a new\nscience of chemistry would have to be learned--\n\nOr that all attempts to find Truth in the special are attempts to find\nthe universal in the local. And artists and their striving for positiveness, under the name of\n\"harmony\"--but their pigments that are oxydizing, or are responding to a\nderanging environment--or the strings of musical instruments that are\ndifferently and disturbingly adjusting to outside chemic and thermal and\ngravitational forces--again and again this oneness of all ideals, and\nthat it is the attempt to be, or to achieve, locally, that which is\nrealizable only universally. In our experience there is only\nintermediateness to harmony and discord. Harmony is that besides which\nthere are no outside forces. And nations that have fought with only one motive: for individuality, or\nentity, or to be real, final nations, not subordinate to, or parts of,\nother nations. And that nothing but intermediateness has ever been\nattained, and that history is record of failures of this one attempt,\nbecause there always have been outside forces, or other nations\ncontending for the same goal. As to physical things, chemic, mineralogic, astronomic, it is not\ncustomary to say that they act to achieve Truth or Entity, but it is\nunderstood that all motions are toward Equilibrium: that there is no\nmotion except toward Equilibrium, of course always away from some other\napproximation to Equilibrium. All biologic phenomena act to adjust: there are no biologic actions\nother than adjustments. Adjustment is another name for Equilibrium. Equilibrium is the\nUniversal, or that which has nothing external to derange it.",

Equilibrium is the\nUniversal, or that which has nothing external to derange it. But that all that we call \"being\" is motion: and that all motion is the\nexpression, not of equilibrium, but of equilibrating, or of equilibrium\nunattained: that life-motions are expressions of equilibrium unattained:\nthat all thought relates to the unattained: that to have what is called\nbeing in our quasi-state, is not to be in the positive sense, or is to\nbe intermediate to Equilibrium and Inequilibrium. So then:\n\nThat all phenomena in our intermediate state, or quasi-state, represent\nthis one attempt to organize, stabilize, harmonize, individualize--or to\npositivize, or to become real:\n\nThat only to have seeming is to express failure or intermediateness to\nfinal failure and final success:\n\nThat every attempt--that is observable--is defeated by Continuity, or by\noutside forces--or by the excluded that are continuous with the\nincluded:\n\nThat our whole \"existence\" is an attempt by the relative to be the\nabsolute, or by the local to be the universal. In this book, my interest is in this attempt as manifested in modern\nscience:\n\nThat it has attempted to be real, true, final, complete, absolute:\n\nThat, if the seeming of being, here, in our quasi-state, is the product\nof exclusion that is always false and arbitrary, if always are included\nand excluded continuous, the whole seeming system, or entity, of modern\nscience is only quasi-system, or quasi-entity, wrought by the same false\nand arbitrary process as that by which the still less positive system\nthat preceded it, or the theological system, wrought the illusion of its\nbeing. In this book, I assemble some of the data that I think are of the\nfalsely and arbitrarily excluded. The data of the damned. I have gone into the outer darkness of scientific and philosophical\ntransactions and proceedings, ultra-respectable, but covered with the\ndust of disregard. I have descended into journalism. I have come back\nwith the quasi-souls of lost data. They will march. * * * * *\n\nAs to the logic of our expressions to come--\n\nThat there is only quasi-logic in our mode of seeming:\n\nThat nothing ever has been proved--\n\nBecause there is nothing to prove. When I say that there is nothing to prove, I mean that to those who\naccept Continuity, or the merging away of all phenomena into other\nphenomena, without positive demarcations one from another, there is, in\na positive sense, no one thing. There is nothing to prove. For instance nothing can be proved to be an animal--because animalness\nand vegetableness are not positively different. There are some\nexpressions of life that are as much vegetable as animal, or that\nrepresent the merging of animalness and vegetableness. There is then no\npositive test, standard, criterion, means of forming an opinion. As\ndistinct from vegetables, animals do not exist. There is nothing to\nprove. Nothing could be proved to be good, for instance. There is\nnothing in our \"existence\" that is good, in a positive sense, or as\nreally outlined from evil. If to forgive be good in times of peace, it\nis evil in wartime. There is nothing to prove: good in our experience is\ncontinuous with, or is only another aspect of evil. As to what I'm trying to do now--I accept only. If I can't see\nuniversally, I only localize. So, of course then, that nothing ever has been proved:\n\nThat theological pronouncements are as much open to doubt as ever they\nwere, but that, by a hypnotizing process, they became dominant over the\nmajority of minds in their era:\n\nThat, in a succeeding era, the laws, dogmas, formulas, principles, of\nmaterialistic science never were proved, because they are only\nlocalizations simulating the universal; but that the leading minds of\ntheir era of dominance were hypnotized into more or less firmly\nbelieving them. Newton's three laws, and that they are attempts to achieve positiveness,\nor to defy and break Continuity, and are as unreal as are all other\nattempts to localize the universal:\n\nThat, if every observable body is continuous, mediately or immediately,\nwith all other bodies, it cannot be influenced only by its own inertia,\nso that there is no way of knowing what the phenomena of inertia may be;\nthat, if all things are reacting to an infinitude of forces, there is no\nway of knowing what the effects of only one impressed force would be;\nthat if every reaction is continuous with its action, it cannot be\nconceived of as a whole, and that there is no way of conceiving what it\nmight be equal and opposite to--\n\nOr that Newton's three laws are three articles of faith:\n\nOr that demons and angels and inertias and reactions are all\nmythological characters:\n\nBut that, in their eras of dominance, they were almost as firmly\nbelieved in as if they had been proved. * * * * *\n\nEnormities and preposterousnesses will march. They will be \"proved\" as well as Moses or Darwin or Lyell ever \"proved\"\nanything. * * * * *\n\nWe substitute acceptance for belief.",

They will be \"proved\" as well as Moses or Darwin or Lyell ever \"proved\"\nanything. * * * * *\n\nWe substitute acceptance for belief. Cells of an embryo take on different appearances in different eras. The more firmly established, the more difficult to change. That social organism is embryonic. That firmly to believe is to impede development. That only temporarily to accept is to facilitate. * * * * *\n\nBut:\n\nExcept that we substitute acceptance for belief, our methods will be the\nconventional methods; the means by which every belief has been\nformulated and supported: or our methods will be the methods of\ntheologians and savages and scientists and children. Because, if all\nphenomena are continuous, there can be no positively different methods. By the inconclusive means and methods of cardinals and fortune tellers\nand evolutionists and peasants, methods which must be inconclusive, if\nthey relate always to the local, and if there is nothing local to\nconclude, we shall write this book. If it function as an expression of its era, it will prevail. * * * * *\n\nAll sciences begin with attempts to define. Nothing ever has been defined. Because there is nothing to define. Darwin wrote _The Origin of Species_. He was never able to tell what he meant by a \"species.\"\n\nIt is not possible to define. Nothing has ever been finally found out. Because there is nothing final to find out. It's like looking for a needle that no one ever lost in a haystack that\nnever was--\n\nBut that all scientific attempts really to find out something, whereas\nreally there is nothing to find out, are attempts, themselves, really to\nbe something. A seeker of Truth. He will never find it. But the dimmest of\npossibilities--he may himself become Truth. Or that science is more than an inquiry:\n\nThat it is a pseudo-construction, or a quasi-organization: that it is an\nattempt to break away and locally establish harmony, stability,\nequilibrium, consistency, entity--\n\nDimmest of possibilities--that it may succeed. * * * * *\n\nThat ours is a pseudo-existence, and that all appearances in it partake\nof its essential fictitiousness--\n\nBut that some appearances approximate far more highly to the positive\nstate than do others. We conceive of all \"things\" as occupying gradations, or steps in series\nbetween positiveness and negativeness, or realness and unrealness: that\nsome seeming things are more nearly consistent, just, beautiful,\nunified, individual, harmonious, stable--than others. We are not realists. We are not idealists. We are intermediatists--that\nnothing is real, but that nothing is unreal: that all phenomena are\napproximations one way or the other between realness and unrealness. So then:\n\nThat our whole quasi-existence is an intermediate stage between\npositiveness and negativeness or realness and unrealness. Like purgatory, I think. But in our summing up, which was very sketchily done, we omitted to make\nclear that Realness is an aspect of the positive state. By Realness, I mean that which does not merge away into something else,\nand that which is not partly something else: that which is not a\nreaction to, or an imitation of, something else. By a real hero, we mean\none who is not partly a coward, or whose actions and motives do not\nmerge away into cowardice. But, if in Continuity, all things do merge,\nby Realness, I mean the Universal, besides which there is nothing with\nwhich to merge. That, though the local might be universalized, it is not conceivable\nthat the universal can be localized: but that high approximations there\nmay be, and that these approximate successes may be translated out of\nIntermediateness into Realness--quite as, in a relative sense, the\nindustrial world recruits itself by translating out of unrealness, or\nout of the seemingly less real imaginings of inventors, machines which\nseem, when set up in factories, to have more of Realness than they had\nwhen only imagined. That all progress, if all progress is toward stability, organization,\nharmony, consistency, or positiveness, is the attempt to become real. So, then, in general metaphysical terms, our expression is that, like a\npurgatory, all that is commonly called \"existence,\" which we call\nIntermediateness, is quasi-existence, neither real nor unreal, but\nexpression of attempt to become real, or to generate for or recruit a\nreal existence. Our acceptance is that Science, though usually thought of so\nspecifically, or in its own local terms, usually supposed to be a prying\ninto old bones, bugs, unsavory messes, is an expression of this one\nspirit animating all Intermediateness: that, if Science could absolutely\nexclude all data but its own present data, or that which is assimilable\nwith the present quasi-organization, it would be a real system, with\npositively definite outlines--it would be real. Its seeming approximation to consistency, stability,\nsystem--positiveness or realness--is sustained by damning the\nirreconcilable or the unassimilable--\n\nAll would be well. All would be heavenly--\n\nIf the damned would only stay damned. In the autumn of 1883, and for years afterward, occurred\nbrilliant-colored sunsets, such as had never been seen before within the\nmemory of all observers. Also there were blue moons. I think that one is likely to smile incredulously at the notion of blue\nmoons. Nevertheless they were as common as were green suns in 1883. Science had to account for these unconventionalities. Such publications\nas _Nature_ and _Knowledge_ were besieged with inquiries. I suppose, in Alaska and in the South Sea Islands, all the medicine men\nwere similarly upon trial. Something had to be thought of. Upon the 28th of August, 1883, the volcano of Krakatoa, of the Straits\nof Sunda, had blown up. Terrific. We're told that the sound was heard 2,000 miles, and that 36,380 persons\nwere killed.

The volume\nof smoke that went up must have been visible to other planets--or,\ntormented with our crawlings and scurryings, the earth complained to\nMars; swore a vast black oath at us. In all text-books that mention this occurrence--no exception so far so I\nhave read--it is said that the extraordinary atmospheric effects of 1883\nwere first noticed in the last of August or the first of September. That makes a difficulty for us. It is said that these phenomena were caused by particles of volcanic\ndust that were cast high in the air by Krakatoa. This is the explanation that was agreed upon in 1883--\n\nBut for seven years the atmospheric phenomena continued--\n\nExcept that, in the seven, there was a lapse of several years--and where\nwas the volcanic dust all that time? You'd think that such a question as that would make trouble? Then you haven't studied hypnosis. You have never tried to demonstrate\nto a hypnotic that a table is not a hippopotamus. According to our\ngeneral acceptance, it would be impossible to demonstrate such a thing. Point out a hundred reasons for saying that a hippopotamus is not a\ntable: you'll have to end up agreeing that neither is a table a\ntable--it only seems to be a table. Well, that's what the hippopotamus\nseems to be. So how can you prove that something is not something else,\nwhen neither is something else some other thing? There's nothing to\nprove. This is one of the profundities that we advertised in advance. You can oppose an absurdity only with some other absurdity. But Science\nis established preposterousness. We divide all intellection: the\nobviously preposterousness and the established. But Krakatoa: that's the explanation that the scientists gave. I don't\nknow what whopper the medicine men told. We see, from the start, the very strong inclination of science to deny,\nas much as it can, external relations of this earth. This book is an assemblage of data of external relations of this earth. We take the position that our data have been damned, upon no\nconsideration for individual merits or demerits, but in conformity with\na general attempt to hold out for isolation of this earth. This is\nattempted positiveness. We take the position that science can no more\nsucceed than, in a similar endeavor, could the Chinese, or than could\nthe United States. So then, with only pseudo-consideration of the\nphenomena of 1883, or as an expression of positivism in its aspect of\nisolation, or unrelatedness, scientists have perpetrated such an\nenormity as suspension of volcanic dust seven years in the\nair--disregarding the lapse of several years--rather than to admit the\narrival of dust from somewhere beyond this earth. Not that scientists\nthemselves have ever achieved positiveness, in its aspect of unitedness,\namong themselves--because Nordenskiold, before 1883, wrote a great deal\nupon his theory of cosmic dust, and Prof. Cleveland Abbe contended\nagainst the Krakatoan explanation--but that this is the orthodoxy of the\nmain body of scientists. My own chief reason for indignation here:\n\nThat this preposterous explanation interferes with some of my own\nenormities. It would cost me too much explaining, if I should have to admit that\nthis earth's atmosphere has such sustaining power. Later, we shall have data of things that have gone up in the air and\nthat have stayed up--somewhere--weeks--months--but not by the sustaining\npower of this earth's atmosphere. For instance, the turtle of Vicksburg. It seems to me that it would be ridiculous to think of a good-sized\nturtle hanging, for three or four months, upheld only by the air, over\nthe town of Vicksburg. When it comes to the horse and the barn--I think\nthat they'll be classics some day, but I can never accept that a horse\nand a barn could float several months in this earth's atmosphere. The orthodox explanation:\n\nSee the _Report of the Krakatoa Committee of the Royal Society_. It\ncomes out absolutely for the orthodox explanation--absolutely and\nbeautifully, also expensively. There are 492 pages in the \"Report,\" and\n40 plates, some of them marvelously colored. It was issued after an\ninvestigation that took five years.

The mathematical parts\nare especially impressive: distribution of the dust of Krakatoa;\nvelocity of translation and rates of subsidence; altitudes and\npersistences--\n\n_Annual Register_, 1883-105:\n\nThat the atmospheric effects that have been attributed to Krakatoa were\nseen in Trinidad before the eruption occurred:\n\n_Knowledge_, 5-418:\n\nThat they were seen in Natal, South Africa, six months before the\neruption. * * * * *\n\nInertia and its inhospitality.

Nevertheless I will engage to list one\nhundred instances, from the _Monthly Weather Review_, of hailstones the\nsize of hens' eggs. There is an account in _Nature_, Nov. 1, 1894, of\nhailstones that weighed almost two pounds each. See Chambers'\nEncyclopedia for three-pounders. _Report of the Smithsonian\nInstitution_, 1870-479--two-pounders authenticated, and six-pounders\nreported. At Seringapatam, India, about the year 1800, fell a\nhailstone--\n\nI fear me, I fear me: this is one of the profoundly damned.

Said to have fallen at Nashville, Tenn.,\nJan. 24, 1891. One smiles. \"In Montana, in the winter of 1887, fell snowflakes 15 inches across,\nand 8 inches thick.\" (_Monthly Weather Review_, 1915-73.)\n\nIn the topography of intellection, I should say that what we call\nknowledge is ignorance surrounded by laughter. * * * * *\n\nBlack rains--red rains--the fall of a thousand tons of butter. Jet-black snow--pink snow--blue hailstones--hailstones flavored like\noranges. Punk and silk and charcoal. * * * * *\n\nAbout one hundred years ago, if anyone was so credulous as to think that\nstones had ever fallen from the sky, he was reasoned with:\n\nIn the first place there are no stones in the sky:\n\nTherefore no stones can fall from the sky. Or nothing more reasonable or scientific or logical than that could be\nsaid upon any subject. The only trouble is the universal trouble: that\nthe major premise is not real, or is intermediate somewhere between\nrealness and unrealness. In 1772, a committee, of whom Lavoisier was a member, was appointed by\nthe French Academy, to investigate a report that a stone had fallen from\nthe sky at Luce, France. Of all attempts at positiveness, in its aspect\nof isolation, I don't know of anything that has been fought harder for\nthan the notion of this earth's unrelatedness. Lavoisier analyzed the\nstone of Luce. The exclusionists' explanation at that time was that\nstones do not fall from the sky: that luminous objects may seem to fall,\nand that hot stones may be picked up where a luminous object seemingly\nhad landed--only lightning striking a stone, heating, even melting it. The stone of Luce showed signs of fusion. Lavoisier's analysis \"absolutely proved\" that this stone had not fallen:\nthat it had been struck by lightning. So, authoritatively, falling stones were damned. The stock means of\nexclusion remained the explanation of lightning that was seen to strike\nsomething--that had been upon the ground in the first place. But positiveness and the fate of every positive statement. It is not\ncustomary to think of damned stones raising an outcry against a sentence\nof exclusion, but, subjectively, aerolites did--or data of them\nbombarded the walls raised against them--\n\n_Monthly Review_, 1796-426\n\n\"The phenomenon which is the subject of the remarks before us will seem\nto most persons as little worthy of credit as any that could be offered. The falling of large stones from the sky, without any assignable cause\nof their previous ascent, seems to partake so much of the marvelous as\nalmost entirely to exclude the operation of known and natural agents. Yet a body of evidence is here brought to prove that such events have\nactually taken place, and we ought not to withhold from it a proper\ndegree of attention.\"\n\nThe writer abandons the first, or absolute, exclusion, and modifies it\nwith the explanation that the day before a reported fall of stones in\nTuscany, in the middle of the decade of the 1790s, there had been an eruption of Vesuvius--\n\nOr that stones do fall from the sky, but that they are stones that have\nbeen raised to the sky from some other part of the earth's surface by\nwhirlwinds or by volcanic action. It's more than one hundred and twenty years later. I know of no aerolite\nthat has ever been acceptably traced to terrestrial origin. Falling stones had to be undamned--though still with a reservation that\nheld out for exclusion of outside forces. One may have the knowledge of a Lavoisier, and still not be able to\nanalyze, not be able even to see, except conformably with the hypnoses,\nor the conventional reactions against hypnoses, of one's era. We believe no more. We accept. Little by little the whirlwind and volcano explanations had to be\nabandoned, but so powerful was this exclusion-hypnosis, sentence of\ndamnation, or this attempt at positiveness, that far into our own times\nsome scientists, notably Prof. Lawrence Smith and Sir Robert Ball,\ncontinued to hold out against all external origins, asserting that\nnothing could fall to this earth, unless it had been cast up or whirled\nup from some other part of this earth's surface.",

We see, to start with, that the virgins of science have fought and wept\nand screamed against external relations--upon two grounds:\n\nThere in the first place;\n\nOr up from one part of this earth's surface and down to another. As late as November, 1902, in _Nature Notes_, 13-231, a member of the\nSelborne Society still argued that meteorites do not fall from the sky;\nthat they are masses of iron upon the ground \"in the first place,\" that\nattract lightning; that the lightning is seen, and is mistaken for a\nfalling, luminous object--\n\nBy progress we mean rape. Butter and beef and blood and a stone with strange inscriptions upon\nit. So then, it is our expression that Science relates to real knowledge no\nmore than does the growth of a plant, or the organization of a\ndepartment store, or the development of a nation: that all are\nassimilative, or organizing, or systematizing processes that represent\ndifferent attempts to attain the positive state--the state commonly\ncalled heaven, I suppose I mean. There can be no real science where there are indeterminate variables,\nbut every variable is, in finer terms, indeterminate, or irregular, if\nonly to have the appearance of being in Intermediateness is to express\nregularity unattained. The invariable, or the real and stable, would be\nnothing at all in Intermediateness--rather as, but in relative terms, an\nundistorted interpretation of external sounds in the mind of a dreamer\ncould not continue to exist in a dreaming mind, because that touch of\nrelative realness would be of awakening and not of dreaming. Science is\nthe attempt to awaken to realness, wherein it is attempt to find\nregularity and uniformity. Or the regular and uniform would be that\nwhich has nothing external to disturb it. By the universal we mean the\nreal. Or the notion is that the underlying super-attempt, as expressed\nin Science, is indifferent to the subject-matter of Science: that the\nattempt to regularize is the vital spirit. Bugs and stars and chemical\nmesses: that they are only quasi-real, and that of them there is nothing\nreal to know; but that systematization of pseudo-data is approximation\nto realness or final awakening--\n\nOr a dreaming mind--and its centaurs and canary birds that turn into\ngiraffes--there could be no real biology upon such subjects, but\nattempt, in a dreaming mind, to systematize such appearances would be\nmovement toward awakening--if better mental co-ordination is all that we\nmean by the state of being awake--relatively awake. So it is, that having attempted to systematize, by ignoring externality\nto the greatest possible degree, the notion of things dropping in upon\nthis earth, from externality, is as unsettling and as unwelcome to\nScience as--tin horns blowing in upon a musician's relatively symmetric\ncomposition--flies alighting upon a painter's attempted harmony, and\ntracking colors one into another--suffragist getting up and making a\npolitical speech at a prayer meeting. If all things are of a oneness, which is a state intermediate to\nunrealness and realness, and if nothing has succeeded in breaking away\nand establishing entity for itself, and could not continue to \"exist\" in\nintermediateness, if it should succeed, any more than could the born\nstill at the same time be the uterine, I of course know of no positive\ndifference between Science and Christian Science--and the attitude of\nboth toward the unwelcome is the same--\"it does not exist.\"\n\nA Lord Kelvin and a Mrs. Eddy, and something not to their liking--it\ndoes not exist. Of course not, we Intermediates say: but, also, that, in\nIntermediateness, neither is there absolute non-existence. Or a Christian Scientist and a toothache--neither exists in the final\nsense: also neither is absolutely non-existent, and, according to our\ntherapeutics, the one that more highly approximates to realness will\nwin. A secret of power--\n\nI think it's another profundity. Do you want power over something? Be more nearly real than it. We'll begin with yellow substances that have fallen upon this earth:\nwe'll see whether our data of them have a higher approximation to\nrealness than have the dogmas of those who deny their existence--that\nis, as products from somewhere external to this earth. In mere impressionism we take our stand. We have no positive tests nor\nstandards. Realism in art: realism in science--they pass away. In 1859,\nthe thing to do was to accept Darwinism; now many biologists are\nrevolting and trying to conceive of something else. The thing to do was\nto accept it in its day, but Darwinism of course was never proved:\n\nThe fittest survive. What is meant by the fittest?",

Although Darwinism, then, seems positively baseless, or absolutely\nirrational, its massing of supposed data, and its attempted coherence\napproximate more highly to Organization and Consistency than did the\ninchoate speculations that preceded it. Or that Columbus never proved that the earth is round. Shadow of the earth on the moon? No one has ever seen it in its entirety. The earth's shadow is much\nlarger than the moon. If the periphery of the shadow is curved--but the\nconvex moon--a straight-edged object will cast a curved shadow upon a\nsurface that is convex. All the other so-called proofs may be taken up in the same way. It was\nimpossible for Columbus to prove that the earth is round. It was not\nrequired: only that with a higher seeming of positiveness than that of\nhis opponents, he should attempt. The thing to do, in 1492, was\nnevertheless to accept that beyond Europe, to the west, were other\nlands. I offer for acceptance, as something concordant with the spirit of this\nfirst quarter of the the 20th century, the expression that beyond this earth\nare--other lands--from which come things as, from America, float things\nto Europe. As to yellow substances that have fallen upon this earth, the endeavor\nto exclude extra-mundane origins is the dogma that all yellow rains and\nyellow snows are colored with pollen from this earth's pine trees. _Symons' Meteorological Magazine_ is especially prudish in this respect\nand regards as highly improper all advances made by other explainers. Nevertheless, the _Monthly Weather Review_, May, 1877, reports a\ngolden-yellow fall, of Feb. 27, 1877, at Peckloh, Germany, in which four\nkinds of organisms, not pollen, were the coloring matter. There were\nminute things shaped like arrows, coffee beans, horns, and disks. They may have been symbols. They may have been objective hieroglyphics--\n\nMere passing fancy--let it go--\n\nIn the _Annales de Chimie_, 85-288, there is a list of rains said to\nhave contained sulphur. I have thirty or forty other notes. I'll not use\none of them. I'll admit that every one of them is upon a fall of pollen. I said, to begin with, that our methods would be the methods of\ntheologians and scientists, and they always begin with an appearance of\nliberality. I grant thirty or forty points to start with. I'm as liberal\nas any of them--or that my liberality won't cost me anything--the\nenormousness of the data that we shall have. Or just to look over a typical instance of this dogma, and the way it\nworks out:\n\nIn the _American Journal of Science_, 1-42-196, we are told of a yellow\nsubstance that fell by the bucketful upon a vessel, one \"windless\" night\nin June, in Pictou Harbor, Nova Scotia. The writer analyzed the\nsubstance, and it was found to \"give off nitrogen and ammonia and an\nanimal odor.\"\n\nNow, one of our Intermediatist principles, to start with, is that so far\nfrom positive, in the aspect of Homogeneousness, are all substances,\nthat, at least in what is called an elementary sense, anything can be\nfound anywhere. Mahogany logs on the coast of Greenland; bugs of a\nvalley on the top of Mt. Blanc; atheists at a prayer meeting; ice in\nIndia. For instance, chemical analysis can reveal that almost any dead\nman was poisoned with arsenic, we'll say, because there is no stomach\nwithout some iron, lead, tin, gold, arsenic in it and of it--which, of\ncourse, in a broader sense, doesn't matter much, because a certain\nnumber of persons must, as a restraining influence, be executed for\nmurder every year; and, if detectives aren't able really to detect\nanything, illusion of their success is all that is necessary, and it is\nvery honorable to give up one's life for society as a whole. The chemist who analyzed the substance of Pictou sent a sample to the\nEditor of the _Journal_. The Editor of course found pollen in it. My own acceptance is that there'd have to be some pollen in it: that\nnothing could very well fall through the air, in June, near the pine\nforests of Nova Scotia, and escape all floating spores of pollen. But\nthe Editor does not say that this substance \"contained\" pollen. He\ndisregards \"nitrogen, ammonia, and an animal odor,\" and says that the\nsubstance was pollen. For the sake of our thirty or forty tokens of\nliberality, or pseudo-liberality, if we can't be really liberal, we\ngrant that the chemist of the first examination probably wouldn't know\nan animal odor if he were janitor of a menagerie.",

As we go along,\nhowever, there can be no such sweeping ignoring of this phenomenon:\n\nThe fall of animal-matter from the sky. I'd suggest, to start with, that we'd put ourselves in the place of\ndeep-sea fishes:\n\nHow would they account for the fall of animal-matter from above? They wouldn't try--\n\nOr it's easy enough to think of most of us as deep-sea fishes of a kind. _Jour. Franklin Inst._, 90-11:\n\nThat, upon the 14th of February, 1870, there fell, at Genoa, Italy,\naccording to Director Boccardo, of the Technical Institute of Genoa, and\nProf. Castellani, a yellow substance. But the microscope revealed\nnumerous globules of cobalt blue, also corpuscles of a pearly color that\nresembled starch. See _Nature_, 2-166. _Comptes Rendus_, 56-972:\n\nM. Bouis says of a substance, reddish varying to yellowish, that fell\nenormously and successively, or upon April 30, May 1 and May 2, in\nFrance and Spain, that it carbonized and spread the odor of charred\nanimal matter--that it was not pollen--that in alcohol it left a residue\nof resinous matter. Hundreds of thousands of tons of this matter must have fallen. \"Odor of charred animal matter.\"\n\nOr an aerial battle that occurred in inter-planetary space several\nhundred years ago--effect of time in making diverse remains uniform in\nappearance--\n\nIt's all very absurd because, even though we are told of a prodigious\nquantity of animal matter that fell from the sky--three days--France and\nSpain--we're not ready yet: that's all. M. Bouis says that this\nsubstance was not pollen; the vastness of the fall makes acceptable that\nit was not pollen; still, the resinous residue does suggest pollen of\npine trees. We shall hear a great deal of a substance with a resinous\nresidue that has fallen from the sky: finally we shall divorce it from\nall suggestion of pollen. _Blackwood's Magazine_, 3-338:\n\nA yellow powder that fell at Gerace, Calabria, about 1813. Some of\nthis substance was collected by Sig. Simenini, Professor of Chemistry,\nat Naples. It had an earthy, insipid taste, and is described as\n\"unctuous.\" When heated, this matter turned brown, then black, then red. According to the _Annals of Philosophy_, 11-466, one of the components\nwas a greenish-yellow substance, which, when dried, was found to be\nresinous. But concomitants of this fall:\n\nLoud noises were heard in the sky. Stones fell from the sky. According to Chladni, these concomitants occurred, and to me they\nseem--rather brutal?--or not associable with something so soft and\ngentle as a fall of pollen? * * * * *\n\nBlack rains and black snows--rains as black as a deluge of\nink--jet-black snowflakes. Such a rain as that which fell in Ireland, about 1840s, described in\nthe _Annals of Scientific Discovery_, 1850, and the _Annual Register_,\n1849. It fell upon a district of 400 square miles, and was the color of\nink, and of a fetid odor and very disagreeable taste. The rain at Castlecommon, Ireland, about 1887--\"thick, black rain.\"\n(_Amer. Met. Jour._, 4-193.)\n\nA black rain fell in Ireland, Oct. 8 and 9, 1907. (_Symons' Met. Mag._\n43-2.) \"It left a most peculiar and disagreeable smell in the air.\"\n\nThe orthodox explanation of this rain occurs in _Nature_, about 1908--cloud of soot that had come from South Wales, crossing the Irish\nChannel and all of Ireland. So the black rain of Ireland, of March, 1898: ascribed in _Symons' Met. Mag._ 33-40, to clouds of soot from the manufacturing towns of North\nEngland and South Scotland. Our Intermediatist principle of pseudo-logic, or our principle of\nContinuity is, of course, that nothing is unique, or individual: that\nall phenomena merge away into all other phenomena: that, for\ninstance--suppose there should be vast celestial super-oceanic, or\ninter-planetary vessels that come near this earth and discharge volumes\nof smoke at times. We're only supposing such a thing as that now,\nbecause, conventionally, we are beginning modestly and tentatively. But\nif it were so, there would necessarily be some phenomenon upon this\nearth, with which that phenomenon would merge. Extra-mundane smoke and\nsmoke from cities merge, or both would manifest in black precipitations\nin rain. In Continuity, it is impossible to distinguish phenomena at their\nmerging-points, so we look for them at their extremes. Impossible to\ndistinguish between animal and vegetable in some infusoria--but\nhippopotamus and violet. For all practical purposes they're\ndistinguishable enough. No one but a Barnum or a Bailey would send one a\nbunch of hippopotami as a token of regard. So away from the great manufacturing centers:\n\nBlack rain in Switzerland, Jan. 20, 1911. Switzerland is so remote, and\nso ill at ease is the conventional explanation here, that _Nature_,\n85-451, says of this rain that in certain conditions of weather, snow\nmay take on an appearance of blackness that is quite deceptive. May be so. Or at night, if dark enough, snow may look black. This is\nsimply denying that a black rain fell in Switzerland, Jan. 20, 1911. Extreme remoteness from great manufacturing centers:\n\n_La Nature_, 1888, 2-406:\n\nThat Aug. 14, 1888, there fell at the Cape of Good Hope, a rain so black\nas to be described as a \"shower of ink.\"\n\nContinuity dogs us. Continuity rules us and pulls us back.",

Continuity rules us and pulls us back. We seemed to\nhave a little hope that by the method of extremes we could get away from\nthings that merge indistinguishably into other things. We find that\nevery departure from one merger is entrance upon another. At the Cape of\nGood Hope, vast volumes of smoke from great manufacturing centers, as an\nexplanation, cannot very acceptably merge with the explanation of\nextra-mundane origin--but smoke from a terrestrial volcano can, and that\nis the suggestion that is made in _La Nature_. There is, in human intellection, no real standard to judge by, but our\nacceptance, for the present, is that the more nearly positive will\nprevail. By the more nearly positive we mean the more nearly Organized. Everything merges away into everything else, but proportionately to its\ncomplexity, if unified, a thing seems strong, real, and distinct: so, in\naesthetics, it is recognized that diversity in unity is higher beauty,\nor approximation to Beauty, than is simpler unity; so the logicians feel\nthat agreement of diverse data constitute greater convincingness, or\nstrength, than that of mere parallel instances: so to Herbert Spencer\nthe more highly differentiated and integrated is the more fully evolved. Our opponents hold out for mundane origin of all black rains. Our method\nwill be the presenting of diverse phenomena in agreement with the notion\nof some other origin. We take up not only black rains but black rains\nand their accompanying phenomena. A correspondent to _Knowledge_, 5-190, writes of a black rain that fell\nin the Clyde Valley, about 1884: of another black rain that fell two\ndays later. According to the correspondent, a black rain had fallen in\nthe Clyde Valley, late in the decade of the 1820s: then again about 1828. According\nto _Nature_, 9-43, a black rain fell at Marlsford, England, Sept. 4,\n1873; more than twenty-four hours later another black rain fell in the\nsame small town. The black rains of Slains:\n\nAccording to Rev. James Rust (_Scottish Showers_):\n\nA black rain at Slains, Jan. 14, 1862--another at Carluke, 140 miles\nfrom Slains, early in the decade of the 1860s--at Slains, about 1862--Slains, Oct. 28,\n1863. But after two of these showers, vast quantities of a substance described\nsometimes as \"pumice stone,\" but sometimes as \"slag,\" were washed upon\nthe sea coast near Slains. A chemist's opinion is given that this\nsubstance was slag: that it was not a volcanic product: slag from\nsmelting works. We now have, for black rains, a concomitant that is\nirreconcilable with origin from factory chimneys. Whatever it may have\nbeen the quantity of this substance was so enormous that, in Mr. Rust's\nopinion, to have produced so much of it would have required the united\noutput of all the smelting works in the world. If slag it were, we\naccept that an artificial product has, in enormous quantities, fallen\nfrom the sky. If you don't think that such occurrences are damned by\nScience, read _Scottish Showers_ and see how impossible it was for the\nauthor to have this matter taken up by the scientific world. The first and second rains corresponded, in time, with ordinary\nebullitions of Vesuvius. The third and fourth, according to Mr. Rust, corresponded with no known\nvolcanic activities upon this earth. _La Science Pour Tous_, 11-26:\n\nThat, between October, 1863, and January, 1866, four more black rains\nfell at Slains, Scotland. The writer of this supplementary account tells us, with a better, or\nmore unscrupulous, orthodoxy than Mr. Rust's, that of the eight black\nrains, five coincided with eruptions of Vesuvius and three with\neruptions of Etna. The fate of all explanation is to close one door only to have another\nfly wide open. I should say that my own notions upon this subject will\nbe considered irrational, but at least my gregariousness is satisfied in\nassociating here with the preposterous--or this writer, and those who\nthink in his rut, have to say that they can think of four discharges\nfrom one far-distant volcano, passing over a great part of Europe,\nprecipitating nowhere else, discharging precisely over one small\nnorthern parish--\n\nBut also of three other discharges, from another far-distant volcano,\nshowing the same precise preference, if not marksmanship, for one small\nparish in Scotland. Nor would orthodoxy be any better off in thinking of exploding\nmeteorites and their d\u00e9bris: preciseness and recurrence would be just as\ndifficult to explain. My own notion is of an island near an oceanic trade-route: it might\nreceive d\u00e9bris from passing vessels seven times in four years. Other concomitants of black rains:\n\nIn Timb's _Year Book_, 1851-270, there is an account of \"a sort of\nrumbling, as of wagons, heard for upward of an hour without ceasing,\"\nabout 1850s, Bulwick Rectory, Northampton, England.

On the 19th, a\nblack rain fell. In _Nature_, 30-6, a correspondent writes of an intense darkness at\nPreston, England, about 1884: page 32, another correspondent writes\nof black rain at Crowle, near Worcester, April 26: that a week later, or\nMay 3, it had fallen again: another account of black rain, upon the 28th\nof April, near Church Shetton, so intense that the following day brooks\nwere still dyed with it. According to four accounts by correspondents to\n_Nature_ there were earthquakes in England at this time. Or the black rain of Canada, Nov. 9, 1819. This time it is orthodoxy to\nattribute the black precipitate to smoke of forest fires south of the\nOhio River--\n\nZurcher, _Meteors_, p. 238:\n\nThat this black rain was accompanied by \"shocks like those of an\nearthquake.\"\n\n_Edinburgh Philosophical Journal_, 2-381:\n\nThat the earthquake had occurred at the climax of intense darkness and\nthe fall of black rain. * * * * *\n\nRed rains. Orthodoxy:\n\nSand blown by the sirocco, from the Sahara to Europe. Especially in the earthquake regions of Europe, there have been many\nfalls of red substance, usually, but not always, precipitated in rain. Upon many occasions, these substances have been \"absolutely identified\"\nas sand from the Sahara. When I first took this matter up, I came\nacross assurance after assurance, so positive to this effect, that, had\nI not been an Intermediatist, I'd have looked no further. Samples\ncollected from a rain at Genoa--samples of sand forwarded from the\nSahara--\"absolute agreement\" some writers said: same color, same\nparticles of quartz, even the same shells of diatoms mixed in. Then the\nchemical analyses: not a disagreement worth mentioning. Our intermediatist means of expression will be that, with proper\nexclusions, after the scientific or theological method, anything can be\nidentified with anything else, if all things are only different\nexpressions of an underlying oneness. To many minds there's rest and there's satisfaction in that expression\n\"absolutely identified.\" Absoluteness, or the illusion of it--the\nuniversal quest. If chemists have identified substances that have fallen\nin Europe as sand from African deserts, swept up in African whirlwinds,\nthat's assuasive to all the irritations that occur to those cloistered\nminds that must repose in the concept of a snug, isolated, little world,\nfree from contact with cosmic wickednesses, safe from stellar guile,\nundisturbed by inter-planetary prowlings and invasions. The only trouble\nis that a chemist's analysis, which seems so final and authoritative to\nsome minds, is no more nearly absolute than is identification by a child\nor description by an imbecile--\n\nI take some of that back: I accept that the approximation is higher--\n\nBut that it's based upon delusion, because there is no definiteness, no\nhomogeneity, no stability, only different stages somewhere between them\nand indefiniteness, heterogeneity, and instability. There are no\nchemical elements. It seems acceptable that Ramsay and others have\nsettled that. The chemical elements are only another disappointment in\nthe quest for the positive, as the definite, the homogeneous, and the\nstable. If there were real elements, there could be a real science of\nchemistry. Upon Nov. 12 and 13, 1902, occurred the greatest fall of matter in the\nhistory of Australia. Upon the 14th of November, it \"rained mud,\" in\nTasmania. It was of course attributed to Australian whirlwinds, but,\naccording to the _Monthly Weather Review_, 32-365, there was a haze all\nthe way to the Philippines, also as far as Hong Kong. It may be that\nthis phenomenon had no especial relation with the even more tremendous\nfall of matter that occurred in Europe, February, 1903. For several days, the south of England was a dumping ground--from\nsomewhere. If you'd like to have a chemist's opinion, even though it's only a\nchemist's opinion, see the report of the meeting of the Royal Chemical\nSociety, about 1903. Mr. E.G. Clayton read a paper upon some of the\nsubstance that had fallen from the sky, collected by him. The Sahara\nexplanation applies mostly to falls that occur in southern Europe. Farther away, the conventionalists are a little uneasy: for instance,\nthe editor of the _Monthly Weather Review_, 29-121, says of a red rain\nthat fell near the coast of Newfoundland, early in 1890: \"It would be\nvery remarkable if this was Sahara dust.\" Mr. Clayton said that the\nmatter examined by him was \"merely wind-borne dust from the roads and\nlanes of Wessex.\" This opinion is typical of all scientific opinion--or\ntheological opinion--or feminine opinion--all very well except for what\nit disregards. The most charitable thing I can think of--because I think\nit gives us a broader tone to relieve our malices with occasional\ncharities--is that Mr. Clayton had not heard of the astonishing extent\nof this fall--had covered the Canary Islands, on the 19th, for instance.",

    "text": "For several days, the south of England was a dumping ground--from\nsomewhere. If you'd like to have a chemist's opinion, even though it's only a\nchemist's opinion, see the report of the meeting of the Royal Chemical\nSociety, about 1903. Mr. E.G. Clayton read a paper upon some of the\nsubstance that had fallen from the sky, collected by him. The Sahara\nexplanation applies mostly to falls that occur in southern Europe. Farther away, the conventionalists are a little uneasy: for instance,\nthe editor of the _Monthly Weather Review_, 29-121, says of a red rain\nthat fell near the coast of Newfoundland, early in 1890: \"It would be\nvery remarkable if this was Sahara dust.\" Mr. Clayton said that the\nmatter examined by him was \"merely wind-borne dust from the roads and\nlanes of Wessex.\" This opinion is typical of all scientific opinion--or\ntheological opinion--or feminine opinion--all very well except for what\nit disregards. The most charitable thing I can think of--because I think\nit gives us a broader tone to relieve our malices with occasional\ncharities--is that Mr. Clayton had not heard of the astonishing extent\nof this fall--had covered the Canary Islands, on the 19th, for instance. I think, myself, that in 1903, we passed through the remains of a\npowdered world--left over from an ancient inter-planetary dispute,\nbrooding in space like a red resentment ever since. Or, like every other\nopinion, the notion of dust from Wessex turns into a provincial thing\nwhen we look it over. To think is to conceive incompletely, because all thought relates only\nto the local. We metaphysicians, of course, like to have the notion that\nwe think of the unthinkable. As to opinions, or pronouncements, I should say, because they always\nhave such an authoritative air, of other chemists, there is an analysis\nin _Nature_, 68-54, giving water and organic matter at 9.08 per cent. It's that carrying out of fractions that's so convincing. The substance\nis identified as sand from the Sahara. The vastness of this fall. In _Nature_, 68-65, we are told that it had\noccurred in Ireland, too. The Sahara, of course--because, prior to\nFebruary 19, there had been dust storms in the Sahara--disregarding that\nin that great region there's always, in some part of it, a dust storm. However, just at present, it does look reasonable that dust had come\nfrom Africa, via the Canaries. The great difficulty that authoritativeness has to contend with is some\nother authoritativeness. When an infallibility clashes with a\npontification--\n\nThey explain. _Nature_, about 1903:\n\nAnother analysis--36 per cent organic matter. Such disagreements don't look very well, so, in _Nature_, 68-109, one of\nthe differing chemists explains. He says that his analysis was of muddy\nrain, and the other was of sediment of rain--\n\nWe're quite ready to accept excuses from the most high, though I do\nwonder whether we're quite so damned as we were, if we find ourselves in\na gracious and tolerant mood toward the powers that condemn--but the tax\nthat now comes upon our good manners and unwillingness to be too\nsevere--\n\n_Nature_, 68-223:\n\nAnother chemist. He says it was 23.49 per cent water and organic matter. He \"identifies\" this matter as sand from an African desert--but after\ndeducting organic matter--\n\nBut you and I could be \"identified\" as sand from an African desert,\nafter deducting all there is to us except sand--\n\nWhy we cannot accept that this fall was of sand from the Sahara,\nomitting the obvious objection that in most parts the Sahara is not red\nat all, but is usually described as \"dazzling white\"--\n\nThe enormousness of it: that a whirlwind might have carried it, but\nthat, in that case it would be no supposititious, or doubtfully\nidentified whirlwind, but the greatest atmospheric cataclysm in the\nhistory of this earth:\n\n_Jour. Roy. Met. Soc._, 30-56:\n\nThat, up to the 27th of February, this fall had continued in Belgium,\nHolland, Germany and Austria; that in some instances it was not sand, or\nthat almost all the matter was organic: that a vessel had reported the\nfall as occurring in the Atlantic Ocean, midway between Southampton and\nthe Barbados. The calculation is given that, in England alone,\n10,000,000 tons of matter had fallen. It had fallen in Switzerland\n(_Symons' Met. Mag._, March, 1903). It had fallen in Russia (_Bull. Com. Geolog._, 22-48). Not only had a vast quantity of matter fallen several\nmonths before, in Australia, but it was at this time falling in\nAustralia (_Victorian Naturalist_, June, 1903)--enormously--red\nmud--fifty tons per square mile. The Wessex explanation--\n\nOr that every explanation is a Wessex explanation: by that I mean an\nattempt to interpret the enormous in terms of the minute--but that\nnothing can be finally explained, because by Truth we mean the\nUniversal; and that even if we could think as wide as Universality, that\nwould not be requital to the cosmic quest--which is not for Truth, but\nfor the local that is true--not to universalize the local, but to\nlocalize the universal--or to give to a cosmic cloud absolute\ninterpretation in terms of the little dusty roads and lanes of Wessex. I\ncannot conceive that this can be done: I think of high approximation. Our Intermediatist concept is that, because of the continuity of all\n\"things,\" which are not separate, positive, or real things, all\npseudo-things partake of the underlying, or are only different\nexpressions, degrees, or aspects of the underlying: so then that a\nsample from somewhere in anything must correspond with a sample from\nsomewhere in anything else. That, by due care in selection, and disregard for everything else, or\nthe scientific and theological method, the substance that fell,\nFebruary, 1903, could be identified with anything, or with some part or\naspect of anything that could be conceived of--\n\nWith sand from the Sahara, sand from a barrel of sugar, or dust of your\ngreat-great-grandfather.",

Different samples are described and listed in the _Journal of the Royal\nMeteorological Society_, 30-57--or we'll see whether my notion that a\nchemist could have identified some one of these samples as from anywhere\nconceivable, is extreme or not:\n\n\"Similar to brick dust,\" in one place; \"buff or light brown,\" in\nanother place; \"chocolate-colored and silky to the touch and slightly\niridescent\"; \"gray\"; \"red-rust color\"; \"reddish raindrops and gray\nsand\"; \"dirty gray\"; \"quite red\"; \"yellow-brown, with a tinge of pink\";\n\"deep yellow-clay color.\"\n\nIn _Nature_, it is described as of a peculiar yellowish cast in one\nplace, reddish somewhere else, and salmon-colored in another place. Or there could be real science if there were really anything to be\nscientific about. Or the science of chemistry is like a science of sociology, prejudiced\nin advance, because only to see is to see with a prejudice, setting out\nto \"prove\" that all inhabitants of New York came from Africa. Very easy matter. Samples from one part of town. Disregard for all the\nrest. There is no science but Wessex-science. According to our acceptance, there should be no other, but that\napproximation should be higher: that metaphysics is super-evil: that the\nscientific spirit is of the cosmic quest. Our notion is that, in a real existence, such a quasi-system of fables\nas the science of chemistry could not deceive for a moment: but that in\nan \"existence\" endeavoring to become real, it represents that endeavor,\nand will continue to impose its pseudo-positiveness until it be driven\nout by a higher approximation to realness:\n\nThat the science of chemistry is as impositive as fortune-telling--\n\nOr no--\n\nThat, though it represents a higher approximation to realness than does\nalchemy, for instance, and so drove out alchemy, it is still only\nsomewhere between myth and positiveness. The attempt at realness, or to state a real and unmodified fact here, is\nthe statement:\n\nAll red rains are colored by sands from the Sahara Desert. My own impositivist acceptances are:\n\nThat some red rains are colored by sands from the Sahara Desert;\n\nSome by sands from other terrestrial sources;\n\nSome by sands from other worlds, or from their deserts--also from\naerial regions too indefinite or amorphous to be thought of as \"worlds\"\nor planets--\n\nThat no supposititious whirlwind can account for the hundreds of\nmillions of tons of matter that fell upon Australia, Pacific Ocean and\nAtlantic Ocean and Europe in 1902 and 1903--that a whirlwind that could\ndo that would not be supposititious. But now we shall cast off some of our own wessicality by accepting that\nthere have been falls of red substance other than sand. We regard every science as an expression of the attempt to be real. But\nto be real is to localize the universal--or to make some one thing as\nwide as all things--successful accomplishment of which I cannot conceive\nof. The prime resistance to this endeavor is the refusal of the rest of\nthe universe to be damned, excluded, disregarded, to receive Christian\nScience treatment, by something else so attempting. Although all\nphenomena are striving for the Absolute--or have surrendered to and have\nincorporated themselves in higher attempts, simply to be phenomenal, or\nto have seeming in Intermediateness is to express relations. A river. It is water expressing the gravitational relation of different levels. The water of the river. Expression of chemic relations of hydrogen and oxygen--which are not\nfinal. A city. Manifestation of commercial and social relations. How could a mountain be without base in a greater body? Storekeeper live without customers? The prime resistance to the positivist attempt by Science is its\nrelations with other phenomena, or that it only expresses those\nrelations in the first place. Or that a Science can have seeming, or\nsurvive in Intermediateness, as something pure, isolated, positively\ndifferent, no more than could a river or a city or a mountain or a\nstore. This Intermediateness-wide attempt by parts to be wholes--which cannot\nbe realized in our quasi-state, if we accept that in it the\nco-existence of two or more wholes or universals is impossible--high\napproximation to which, however, may be thinkable--\n\nScientists and their dream of \"pure science.\"\n\nArtists and their dream of \"art for art's sake.\"\n\nIt is our notion that if they could almost realize, that would be almost\nrealness: that they would instantly be translated into real existence. Such thinkers are good positivists, but they are evil in an economic and\nsociologic sense, if, in that sense, nothing has justification for\nbeing, unless it serve, or function for, or express the relations of,\nsome higher aggregate. So Science functions for and serves society at\nlarge, and would, from society at large, receive no support, unless it\ndid so divert itself or dissipate and prostitute itself. It seems that\nby prostitution I mean usefulness. There have been red rains that, in the middle ages, were called \"rains\nof blood.\" Such rains terrified many persons, and were so unsettling to\nlarge populations, that Science, in its sociologic relations, has\nsought, by Mrs. Eddy's method, to remove an evil--\n\nThat \"rains of blood\" do not exist;\n\nThat rains so called are only of water colored by sand from the Sahara\nDesert.",

My own acceptance is that such assurances, whether fictitious or not,\nwhether the Sahara is a \"dazzling white\" desert or not, have wrought\nsuch good effects, in a sociologic sense, even though prostitutional in\nthe positivist sense, that, in the sociologic sense, they were well\njustified:\n\nBut that we've gone on: that this is the twentieth century; that most of\nus have grown up so that such soporifics of the past are no longer\nnecessary:\n\nThat if gushes of blood should fall from the sky upon New York City,\nbusiness would go on as usual. We began with rains that we accepted ourselves were, most likely, only\nof sand. In my own still immature hereticalness--and by heresy, or\nprogress, I mean, very largely, a return, though with many\nmodifications, to the superstitions of the past, I think I feel\nconsiderable aloofness to the idea of rains of blood. Just at present,\nit is my conservative, or timid purpose, to express only that there\nhave been red rains that very strongly suggest blood or finely divided\nanimal matter--\n\nD\u00e9bris from inter-planetary disasters. Aerial battles. Food-supplies from cargoes of super-vessels, wrecked in inter-planetary\ntraffic. There was a red rain in the Mediterranean region, about 1888. Twelve\ndays later, it fell again. Whatever this substance may have been, when\nburned, the odor of animal matter from it was strong and persistent. (_L'Astronomie_, 1888-205.)\n\nBut--infinite heterogeneity--or d\u00e9bris from many different kinds of\naerial cargoes--there have been red rains that have been colored by\nneither sand nor animal matter. _Annals of Philosophy_, 16-226:\n\nThat, Nov. 2, 1819--week before the black rain and earthquake of\nCanada--there fell, at Blankenberge, Holland, a red rain. As to sand,\ntwo chemists of Bruges concentrated 144 ounces of the rain to 4\nounces--\"no precipitate fell.\" But the color was so marked that had\nthere been sand, it would have been deposited, if the substance had been\ndiluted instead of concentrated. Experiments were made, and various\nreagents did cast precipitates, but other than sand. The chemists\nconcluded that the rain-water contained muriate of cobalt--which is not\nvery enlightening: that could be said of many substances carried in\nvessels upon the Atlantic Ocean. Whatever it may have been, in the\n_Annales de Chimie_, 2-12-432, its color is said to have been\nred-violet. For various chemic reactions, see _Quar. Jour. Roy. Inst._,\n9-202, and _Edin. Phil. Jour._, 2-381. Something that fell with dust said to have been meteoric, March 9, 10,\n11, 1872: described in the _Chemical News_, 25-300, as a \"peculiar\nsubstance,\" consisted of red iron ocher, carbonate of lime, and organic\nmatter. Orange-red hail, in the middle of the decade of the 1870s, in Tuscany. (Notes and Queries 9-5-16.)\n\nRain of lavender-colored substance, at Oudon, France, Dec. 19, 1903. (_Bull. Soc. Met. de France_, 1904-124.)\n\n_La Nature_, 1885-2-351:\n\nThat, according to Prof. Schwedoff, there fell, in Russia, about 1880, red hailstones, also blue hailstones, also gray hailstones. _Nature_, 34-123:\n\nA correspondent writes that he had been told by a resident of a small\ntown in Venezuela, that there, about 1886, had fallen hailstones,\nsome red, some blue, some whitish: informant said to have been one\nunlikely ever to have heard of the Russian phenomenon; described as an\n\"honest, plain countryman.\"\n\n_Nature_, about 1877, quotes a Roman correspondent to the London\n_Times_ who sent a translation from an Italian newspaper: that a red\nrain had fallen in Italy, about 1877, containing \"microscopically\nsmall particles of sand.\"\n\nOr, according to our acceptance, any other story would have been an evil\nthing, in the sociologic sense, in Italy, in 1877. But the English\ncorrespondent, from a land where terrifying red rains are uncommon, does\nnot feel this necessity. He writes: \"I am by no means satisfied that the\nrain was of sand and water.\" His observations are that drops of this\nrain left stains \"such as sandy water could not leave.\" He notes that\nwhen the water evaporated, no sand was left behind. _L'Ann\u00e9e Scientifique_, 1888-75:\n\nThat, Dec. 13, 1887, there fell, in Cochin China, a substance like\nblood, somewhat coagulated. _Annales de Chimie_, 85-266:\n\nThat a thick, viscous, red matter fell at Ulm, in 1812. We now have a datum with a factor that has been foreshadowed; which will\nrecur and recur and recur throughout this book. It is a factor that\nmakes for speculation so revolutionary that it will have to be\nreinforced many times before we can take it into full acceptance. _Year Book of Facts_, 1861-273:\n\nQuotation from a letter from Prof. Campini to Prof. Matteucci:\n\nThat, upon Dec. 28, 1860, at about 7 A.M., in the northwestern part of\nSiena, a reddish rain fell copiously for two hours. A second red shower fell at 11 o'clock. Three days later, the red rain fell again. The next day another red rain fell.",

A second red shower fell at 11 o'clock. Three days later, the red rain fell again. The next day another red rain fell. Still more extraordinarily:\n\nEach fall occurred in \"exactly the same quarter of town.\"\n\n\nIt is in the records of the French Academy that, upon about 1669, in\nthe town of Ch\u00e2tillon-sur-Seine, fell a reddish substance that was\n\"thick, viscous, and putrid.\"\n\n_American Journal of Science_, 1-41-404:\n\nStory of a highly unpleasant substance that had fallen from the sky, in\nWilson County, Tennessee. We read that Dr. Troost visited the place and\ninvestigated. Later we're going to investigate some investigations--but\nnever mind that now. Dr. Troost reported that the substance was clear\nblood and portions of flesh scattered upon tobacco fields. He argued\nthat a whirlwind might have taken an animal up from one place, mauled it\naround, and have precipitated its remains somewhere else. But, in volume 44, page 216, of the _Journal_, there is an apology. The\nwhole matter is, upon newspaper authority, said to have been a hoax by\nNegroes, who had pretended to have seen the shower, for the sake of\npracticing upon the credulity of their masters: that they had scattered\nthe decaying flesh of a dead hog over the tobacco fields. If we don't accept this datum, at least we see the sociologically\nnecessary determination to have all falls accredited to earthly\norigins--even when they're falls that don't fall. _Annual Register_, 1821-687:\n\nThat, upon the 13th of August, 1819, something had fallen from the sky\nat Amherst, Mass. It had been examined and described by Prof. Graves,\nformerly lecturer at Dartmouth College. It was an object that had upon\nit a nap, similar to that of milled cloth. Upon removing this nap, a\nbuff-colored, pulpy substance was found. It had an offensive odor, and,\nupon exposure to the air, turned to a vivid red. This thing was said to\nhave fallen with a brilliant light. Also see the _Edinburgh Philosophical Journal_, 5-295. In the _Annales\nde Chimie_, 1821-67, M. Arago accepts the datum, and gives four\ninstances of similar objects or substances said to have fallen from the\nsky, two of which we shall have with our data of gelatinous, or viscous\nmatter, and two of which I omit, because it seems to me that the dates\ngiven are too far back. In the _American Journal of Science_, 1-2-335, is Professor Graves'\naccount, communicated by Professor Dewey:\n\nThat, upon the evening of about 1819, a light was seen in\nAmherst--a falling object--sound as if of an explosion. In the home of Prof. Dewey, this light was reflected upon a wall of a\nroom in which were several members of Prof. Dewey's family. The next morning, in Prof. Dewey's front yard, in what is said to have\nbeen the only position from which the light that had been seen in the\nroom, the night before, could have been reflected, was found a substance\n\"unlike anything before observed by anyone who saw it.\" It was a\nbowl-shaped object, about 8 inches in diameter, and one inch thick. Bright buff-colored, and having upon it a \"fine nap.\" Upon removing this\ncovering, a buff-colored, pulpy substance of the consistency of\nsoft-soap, was found--\"of an offensive, suffocating smell.\"\n\nA few minutes of exposure to the air changed the buff color to \"a livid\ncolor resembling venous blood.\" It absorbed moisture quickly from the\nair and liquefied. For some of the chemic reactions, see the _Journal_. There's another lost quasi-soul of a datum that seems to me to belong\nhere:\n\nLondon _Times_, about 1836:\n\nFall of fish that had occurred in the neighborhood of Allahabad, India. It is said that the fish were of the chalwa species, about a span in\nlength and a seer in weight--you know. They were dead and dry. Or they had been such a long time out of water that we can't accept that\nthey had been scooped out of a pond, by a whirlwind--even though they\nwere so definitely identified as of a known local species--\n\nOr they were not fish at all. I incline, myself, to the acceptance that they were not fish, but\nslender, fish-shaped objects of the same substance as that which fell at\nAmherst--it is said that, whatever they were, they could not be eaten:\nthat \"in the pan, they turned to blood.\"\n\nFor details of this story see the _Journal of the Asiatic Society of\nBengal_, 1834-307. May 16 or 17, 1834, is the date given in the\n_Journal_. In the _American Journal of Science_, 1-25-362, occurs the inevitable\ndamnation of the Amherst object:\n\nProf. Edward Hitchcock went to live in Amherst. He says that years\nlater, another object, like the one said to have fallen in 1819, had\nbeen found at \"nearly the same place.\" Prof. Hitchcock was invited by\nProf. Graves to examine it. Exactly like the first one. Corresponded in\nsize and color and consistency. The chemic reactions were the same. Prof. Hitchcock recognized it in a moment.",

Exactly like the first one. Corresponded in\nsize and color and consistency. The chemic reactions were the same. Prof. Hitchcock recognized it in a moment. It was a gelatinous fungus. He did not satisfy himself as to just the exact species it belonged to,\nbut he predicted that similar fungi might spring up within twenty-four\nhours--\n\nBut, before evening, two others sprang up. Or we've arrived at one of the oldest of the exclusionists'\nconventions--or nostoc. We shall have many data of gelatinous substance\nsaid to have fallen from the sky: almost always the exclusionists argue\nthat it was only nostoc, an Alga, or, in some respects, a fungous\ngrowth. The rival convention is \"spawn of frogs or of fishes.\" These two\nconventions have made a strong combination. In instances where testimony\nwas not convincing that gelatinous matter had been seen to fall, it was\nsaid that the gelatinous substance was nostoc, and had been upon the\nground in the first place: when the testimony was too good that it had\nfallen, it was said to be spawn that had been carried from one place to\nanother in a whirlwind. Now, I can't say that nostoc is always greenish, any more than I can say\nthat blackbirds are always black, having seen a white one: we shall\nquote a scientist who knew of flesh-colored nostoc, when so to know was\nconvenient. When we come to reported falls of gelatinous substances, I'd\nlike it to be noticed how often they are described as whitish or\ngrayish. In looking up the subject, myself, I have read only of\ngreenish nostoc. Said to be greenish, in Webster's Dictionary--said to\nbe \"blue-green\" in the New International Encyclopedia--\"from bright\ngreen to olive-green\" (_Science Gossip_, 10-114); \"green\" (_Science\nGossip_, 7-260); \"greenish\" (_Notes and Queries_, 1-11-219). It would\nseem acceptable that, if many reports of white birds should occur, the\nbirds are not blackbirds, even though there have been white blackbirds. Or that, if often reported, grayish or whitish gelatinous substance is\nnot nostoc, and is not spawn if occurring in times unseasonable for\nspawn. \"The Kentucky Phenomenon.\"\n\nSo it was called, in its day, and now we have an occurrence that\nattracted a great deal of attention in its own time. Usually these\nthings of the accursed have been hushed up or disregarded--suppressed\nlike the seven black rains of Slains--but, upon about 1876, something\noccurred, in Bath County, Kentucky, that brought many newspaper\ncorrespondents to the scene. The substance that looked like beef that fell from the sky. Upon about 1876, at Olympian Springs, Bath County, Kentucky, flakes\nof a substance that looked like beef fell from the sky--\"from a clear\nsky.\" We'd like to emphasize that it was said that nothing but this\nfalling substance was visible in the sky. It fell in flakes of various\nsizes; some two inches square, one, three or four inches square. The\nflake-formation is interesting: later we shall think of it as signifying\npressure--somewhere. It was a thick shower, on the ground, on trees, on\nfences, but it was narrowly localized: or upon a strip of land about 100\nyards long and about 50 yards wide. For the first account, see the\n_Scientific American_, 34-197, and the _New York Times_, about 1876. Then the exclusionists. Something that looked like beef: one flake of it the size of a square\nenvelope. If we think of how hard the exclusionists have fought to reject the\ncoming of ordinary-looking dust from this earth's externality, we can\nsympathize with them in this sensational instance, perhaps. Newspaper\ncorrespondents wrote broadcast and witnesses were quoted, and this time\nthere is no mention of a hoax, and, except by one scientist, there is no\ndenial that the fall did take place. It seems to me that the exclusionists are still more emphatically\nconservators. It is not so much that they are inimical to all data of\nexternally derived substances that fall upon this earth, as that they\nare inimical to all data discordant with a system that does not include\nsuch phenomena--\n\nOr the spirit or hope or ambition of the cosmos, which we call attempted\npositivism: not to find out the new; not to add to what is called\nknowledge, but to systematize. _Scientific American Supplement_, 2-426:\n\nThat the substance reported from Kentucky had been examined by Leopold\nBrandeis. \"At last we have a proper explanation of this much talked of\nphenomenon.\"\n\n\"It has been comparatively easy to identify the substance and to fix its\nstatus. The Kentucky 'wonder' is no more or less than nostoc.\"\n\nOr that it had not fallen; that it had been upon the ground in the first\nplace, and had swollen in rain, and, attracting attention by greatly\nincreased volume, had been supposed by unscientific observers to have\nfallen in rain--\n\nWhat rain, I don't know.

Also it is spoken of as \"dried\" several times. That's one of the most\nimportant of the details. But the relief of outraged propriety, expressed in the _Supplement_, is\namusing to some of us, who, I fear, may be a little improper at times. Very spirit of the Salvation Army, when some third-rate scientist comes\nout with an explanation of the vermiform appendix or the os coccygis\nthat would have been acceptable to Moses. To give completeness to \"the\nproper explanation,\" it is said that Mr. Brandeis had identified the\nsubstance as \"flesh-colored\" nostoc. Prof. Lawrence Smith, of Kentucky, one of the most resolute of the\nexclusionists:\n\n_New York Times_, in the middle of the decade of the 1870s:\n\nThat the substance had been examined and analyzed by Prof. Smith,\naccording to whom it gave every indication of being the \"dried\" spawn of\nsome reptile, \"doubtless of the frog\"--or up from one place and down in\nanother. As to \"dried,\" that may refer to condition when Prof. Smith\nreceived it. In the _Scientific American Supplement_, 2-473, Dr. A. Mead Edwards,\nPresident of the Newark Scientific Association, writes that, when he saw\nMr. Brandeis' communication, his feeling was of conviction that\npropriety had been re-established, or that the problem had been solved,\nas he expresses it: knowing Mr. Brandeis well, he had called upon that\nupholder of respectability, to see the substance that had been\nidentified as nostoc. But he had also called upon Dr. Hamilton, who had\na specimen, and Dr. Hamilton had declared it to be lung-tissue. Dr. Edwards writes of the substance that had so completely, or\nbeautifully--if beauty is completeness--been identified as nostoc--\"It\nturned out to be lung-tissue also.\" He wrote to other persons who had\nspecimens, and identified other specimens as masses of cartilage or\nmuscular fibers. \"As to whence it came, I have no theory.\" Nevertheless\nhe endorses the local explanation--and a bizarre thing it is:\n\nA flock of gorged, heavy-weighted buzzards, but far up and invisible in\nthe clear sky--\n\nThey had disgorged. Prof. Fassig lists the substance, in his \"Bibliography,\" as fish spawn. McAtee (_Monthly Weather Review_, May, 1918) lists it as a jelly-like\nmaterial, supposed to have been the \"dried\" spawn either of fishes or of\nsome batrachian. Or this is why, against the seemingly insuperable odds against all\nthings new, there can be what is called progress--\n\nThat nothing is positive, in the aspects of homogeneity and unity:\n\nIf the whole world should seem to combine against you, it is only unreal\ncombination, or intermediateness to unity and disunity. Every resistance\nis itself divided into parts resisting one another. The simplest\nstrategy seems to be--never bother to fight a thing: set its own parts\nfighting one another. We are merging away from carnal to gelatinous substance, and here there\nis an abundance of instances or reports of instances. These data are so\nimproper they're obscene to the science of today, but we shall see that\nscience, before it became so rigorous, was not so prudish. Chladni was\nnot, and Greg was not. I shall have to accept, myself, that gelatinous substance has often\nfallen from the sky--\n\nOr that, far up, or far away, the whole sky is gelatinous? That meteors tear through and detach fragments? That fragments are brought down by storms? That the twinkling of stars is penetration of light through something\nthat quivers? I think, myself, that it would be absurd to say that the whole sky is\ngelatinous: it seems more acceptable that only certain areas are. Humboldt (_Cosmos_, 1-119) says that all our data in this respect must\nbe \"classed amongst the mythical fables of mythology.\" He is very sure,\nbut just a little redundant. We shall be opposed by the standard resistances:\n\nThere in the first place;\n\nUp from one place, in a whirlwind, and down in another. We shall not bother to be very convincing one way or another, because of\nthe over-shadowing of the datum with which we shall end up. It will mean\nthat something had been in a stationary position for several days over a\nsmall part of a small town in England: this is the revolutionary thing\nthat we have alluded to before; whether the substance were nostoc, or\nspawn, or some kind of a larval nexus, doesn't matter so much. If it\nstood in the sky for several days, we rank with Moses as a chronicler of\nimproprieties--or was that story, or datum, we mean, told by Moses? Then\nwe shall have so many records of gelatinous substance said to have\nfallen with meteorites, that, between the two phenomena, some of us will\nhave to accept connection--or that there are at least vast gelatinous\nareas aloft, and that meteorites tear through, carrying down some of the\nsubstance. _Comptes Rendus_, 3-554:\n\nThat, in 1836, M.",

Vallot, member of the French Academy, placed before\nthe Academy some fragments of a gelatinous substance, said to have\nfallen from the sky, and asked that they be analyzed. There is no\nfurther allusion to this subject. _Comptes Rendus_, 23-542:\n\nThat, in Wilna, Lithuania, about 1846, in a rainstorm, fell nut-sized\nmasses of a substance that is described as both resinous and\ngelatinous. It was odorless until burned: then it spread a very\npronounced sweetish odor. It is described as like gelatine, but much\nfirmer: but, having been in water 24 hours, it swelled out, and looked\naltogether gelatinous--\n\nIt was grayish. We are told that, in 1841 and 1846, a similar substance had fallen in\nAsia Minor. In _Notes and Queries_, 8-6-190, it is said that, early in August, 1894,\nthousands of jellyfish, about the size of a shilling, had fallen at\nBath, England. I think it is not acceptable that they were jellyfish:\nbut it does look as if this time frog spawn did fall from the sky, and\nmay have been translated by a whirlwind--because, at the same time,\nsmall frogs fell at Wigan, England. _Nature_, 87-10:\n\nThat, about 1911, at Eton, Bucks, England, the ground was found\ncovered with masses of jelly, the size of peas, after a heavy rainfall. We are not told of nostoc, this time: it is said that the object\ncontained numerous eggs of \"some species of Chironomus, from which\nlarvae soon emerged.\"\n\nI incline, then, to think that the objects that fell at Bath were\nneither jellyfish nor masses of frog spawn, but something of a larval\nkind--\n\nThis is what had occurred at Bath, England, 23 years before. London _Times_, about 1871:\n\nThat, upon the 22nd of April, 1871, a storm of glutinous drops neither\njellyfish nor masses of frog spawn, but something of a [line missing\nhere in original text. Ed.] railroad station, at Bath. \"Many soon\ndeveloped into a worm-like chrysalis, about an inch in length.\" The\naccount of this occurrence in the _Zoologist_, 2-6-2686, is more like\nthe Eton-datum: of minute forms, said to have been infusoria; not forms\nabout an inch in length. _Trans. Ent. Soc. of London_, 1871-proc. xxii:\n\nThat the phenomenon has been investigated by the Rev. L. Jenyns, of\nBath. His description is of minute worms in filmy envelopes. He tries to\naccount for their segregation. The mystery of it is: What could have\nbrought so many of them together? Many other falls we shall have record\nof, and in most of them segregation is the great mystery. A whirlwind\nseems anything but a segregative force. Segregation of things that have\nfallen from the sky has been avoided as most deep-dyed of the damned. Mr. Jenyns conceives of a large pool, in which were many of these\nspherical masses: of the pool drying up and concentrating all in a small\narea; of a whirlwind then scooping all up together--\n\nBut several days later, more of these objects fell in the same place. That such marksmanship is not attributable to whirlwinds seems to me to\nbe what we think we mean by common sense:\n\nIt may not look like common sense to say that these things had been\nstationary over the town of Bath, several days--\n\nThe seven black rains of Slains;\n\nThe four red rains of Siena. An interesting sidelight on the mechanics of orthodoxy is that Mr. Jenyns dutifully records the second fall, but ignores it in his\nexplanation. R.P. Greg, one of the most notable of cataloguers of meteoritic\nphenomena, records (_Phil. Mag._: 4-8-463) falls of viscid substance in\nthe years 1652, 1686, 1718, 1796, 1811, 1819, 1844. He gives earlier\ndates, but I practice exclusions, myself. In the _Report of the British\nAssociation_, 1860-63, Greg records a meteor that seemed to pass near\nthe ground, between Barsdorf and Freiburg, Germany: the next day a\njelly-like mass was found in the snow--\n\nUnseasonableness for either spawn or nostoc. Greg's comment in this instance is: \"Curious if true.\" But he records\nwithout modification the fall of a meteorite at Gotha, Germany, Sept. 6,\n1835, \"leaving a jelly-like mass on the ground.\" We are told that this\nsubstance fell only three feet away from an observer. In the _Report of\nthe British Association_, 1855-94, according to a letter from Greg to\nProf. Baden-Powell, at night, Oct. 8, 1844, near Coblenz, a German, who\nwas known to Greg, and another person saw a luminous body fall close to\nthem. They returned next morning and found a gelatinous mass of grayish\ncolor. According to Chladni's account (_Annals of Philosophy_, n.s., 12-94) a\nviscous mass fell with a luminous meteorite between Siena and Rome,\nMay, 1652; viscous matter found after the fall of a fire ball, in\nLusatia, March, 1796; fall of a gelatinous substance, after the\nexplosion of a meteorite, near Heidelberg, July, 1811.",

In the _Edinburgh\nPhilosophical Journal_, 1-234, the substance that fell at Lusatia is\nsaid to have been of the \"color and odor of dried, brown varnish.\" In\nthe _Amer. Jour. Sci._, 1-26-133, it is said that gelatinous matter fell\nwith a globe of fire, upon the island of Lethy, India, 1718. In the _Amer. Jour. Sci._, 1-26-396, in many observations upon the\nmeteors of November, 1833, are reports of falls of gelatinous substance:\n\nThat, according to newspaper reports, \"lumps of jelly\" were found on the\nground at Rahway, N.J. The substance was whitish, or resembled the\ncoagulated white of an egg:\n\nThat Mr. H.H. Garland, of Nelson County, Virginia, had found a\njelly-like substance of about the circumference of a twenty-five-cent\npiece:\n\nThat, according to a communication from A.C. Twining to Prof. Olmstead,\na woman at West Point, N.Y., had seen a mass the size of a teacup. It\nlooked like boiled starch:\n\nThat, according to a newspaper, of Newark, N.J., a mass of gelatinous\nsubstance, like soft soap, had been found. \"It possessed little\nelasticity, and, on the application of heat, it evaporated as readily as\nwater.\"\n\nIt seems incredible that a scientist would have such hardihood, or\ninfidelity, as to accept that these things had fallen from the sky:\nnevertheless, Prof. Olmstead, who collected these lost souls, says:\n\n\"The fact that the supposed deposits were so uniformly described as\ngelatinous substance forms a presumption in favor of the supposition\nthat they had the origin ascribed to them.\"\n\nIn contemporaneous scientific publications considerable attention was\ngiven to Prof. Olmstead's series of papers upon this subject of the\nNovember meteors. You will not find one mention of the part that treats\nof gelatinous matter. I shall attempt not much of correlation of dates. A mathematic-minded\npositivist, with his delusion that in an intermediate state twice two\nare four, whereas, if we accept Continuity, we cannot accept that there\nare anywhere two things to start with, would search our data for\nperiodicities. It is so obvious to me that the mathematic, or the\nregular, is the attribute of the Universal, that I have not much\ninclination to look for it in the local. Still, in this solar system,\n\"as a whole,\" there is considerable approximation to regularity; or the\nmathematic is so nearly localized that eclipses, for instance, can, with\nrather high approximation, be foretold, though I have notes that would\ndeflate a little the astronomers' vainglory in this respect--or would if\nthat were possible. An astronomer is poorly paid, uncheered by crowds,\nconsiderably isolated: he lives upon his own inflations: deflate a bear\nand it couldn't hibernate. This solar system is like every other\nphenomenon that can be regarded \"as a whole\"--or the affairs of a ward\nare interfered with by the affairs of the city of which it is a part;\ncity by county; county by state; state by nation; nation by other\nnations; all nations by climatic conditions; climatic conditions by\nsolar circumstances; sun by general planetary circumstances; solar\nsystem \"as a whole\" by other solar systems--so the hopelessness of\nfinding the phenomena of entirety in the ward of a city. But positivists\nare those who try to find the unrelated in the ward of a city. In our\nacceptance this is the spirit of cosmic religion. Objectively the state\nis not realizable in the ward of a city. But, if a positivist could\nbring himself to absolute belief that he had found it, that would be a\nsubjective realization of that which is unrealizable objectively. Of\ncourse we do not draw a positive line between the objective and the\nsubjective--or that all phenomena called things or persons are\nsubjective within one all-inclusive nexus, and that thoughts within\nthose that are commonly called \"persons\" are sub-subjective. It is\nrather as if Intermediateness strove for Regularity in this solar\nsystem and failed: then generated the mentality of astronomers, and, in\nthat secondary expression, strove for conviction that failure had been\nsuccess. I have tabulated all the data of this book, and a great deal\nbesides--card system--and several proximities, thus emphasized, have\nbeen revelations to me: nevertheless, it is only the method of\ntheologians and scientists--worst of all, of statisticians. For instance, by the statistic method, I could \"prove\" that a black rain\nhas fallen \"regularly\" every seven months, somewhere upon this earth. To\ndo this, I'd have to include red rains and yellow rains, but,\nconventionally, I'd pick out the black particles in red substances and\nin yellow substances, and disregard the rest. Then, too, if here and\nthere a black rain should be a week early or a month late--that would be\n\"acceleration\" or \"retardation.\" This is supposed to be legitimate in\nworking out the periodicities of comets.",

If black rains, or red or\nyellow rains with black particles in them, should not appear at all near\nsome dates--we have not read Darwin in vain--\"the records are not\ncomplete.\" As to other, interfering black rains, they'd be either gray\nor brown, or for them we'd find other periodicities. Still, I have had to notice the year 1819, for instance. I shall not\nnote them all in this book, but I have records of 31 extraordinary\nevents in 1883. Someone should write a book upon the phenomena of this\none year--that is, if books should be written. 1849 is notable for\nextraordinary falls, so far apart that a local explanation seems\ninadequate--not only the black rain of Ireland, May, 1849, but a red\nrain in Sicily and a red rain in Wales. Also, it is said (Timb's _Year\nBook_, 1850-241) that, upon April 18 or 20, 1849, shepherds near Mt. Ararat, found a substance that was not indigenous, upon areas measuring\n8 to 10 miles in circumference. Presumably it had fallen there. We have already gone into the subject of Science and its attempted\npositiveness, and its resistances in that it must have relations of\nservice. It is very easy to see that most of the theoretic science of\nthe the 19th century was only a relation of reaction against theologic\ndogma, and has no more to do with Truth than has a wave that bounds back\nfrom a shore. Or, if a shop girl, or you or I, should pull out a piece\nof chewing gum about a yard long, that would be quite as scientific a\nperformance as was the stretching of this earth's age several hundred\nmillions of years. All \"things\" are not things, but only relations, or expressions of\nrelations: but all relations are striving to be the unrelated, or have\nsurrendered to, and subordinated to, higher attempts. So there is a\npositivist aspect to this reaction that is itself only a relation, and\nthat is the attempt to assimilate all phenomena under the materialist\nexplanation, or to formulate a final, all-inclusive system, upon the\nmaterialist basis. If this attempt could be realized, that would be the\nattaining of realness; but this attempt can be made only by disregarding\npsychic phenomena, for instance--or, if science shall eventually give in\nto the psychic, it would be no more legitimate to explain the immaterial\nin terms of the material than to explain the material in terms of the\nimmaterial. Our own acceptance is that material and immaterial are of a\noneness, merging, for instance, in a thought that is continuous with a\nphysical action: that oneness cannot be explained, because the process\nof explaining is the interpreting of something in terms of something\nelse. All explanation is assimilation of something in terms of something\nelse that has been taken as a basis: but, in Continuity, there is\nnothing that is any more basic than anything else--unless we think that\ndelusion built upon delusion is less real than its pseudo-foundation. In 1829 (Timb's _Year Book_, 1848-235) in Persia fell a substance that\nthe people said they had never seen before. As to what it was, they had\nnot a notion, but they saw that the sheep ate it. They ground it into\nflour and made bread, said to have been passable enough, though insipid. That was a chance that science did not neglect. Manna was placed upon a\nreasonable basis, or was assimilated and reconciled with the system that\nhad ousted the older--and less nearly real--system. It was said that,\nlikely enough, manna had fallen in ancient times--because it was still\nfalling--but that there was no tutelary influence behind it--that it was\na lichen from the steppes of Asia Minor--from one place in a whirlwind\nand down in another place. \"In the _American Almanac_, 1833-71, it is\nsaid that this substance--to the inhabitants of the region\"--was\n\"immediately recognized\" by scientists who examined it: and that \"the\nchemical analysis also identified it as a lichen.\"\n\nThis was back in the days when Chemical Analysis was a god. Since then\nhis devotees have been shocked and disillusioned. Just how a chemical\nanalysis could so botanize, I don't know--but it was Chemical Analysis\nwho spoke, and spoke dogmatically. It seems to me that the ignorance of\ninhabitants, contrasting with the local knowledge of foreign scientists,\nis overdone: if there's anything good to eat, within any distance\nconveniently covered by a whirlwind--inhabitants know it.

They\nare all dogmatically said to be \"manna\"; and \"manna\" is dogmatically\nsaid to be a species of lichens from the steppes of Asia Minor. The\nposition that I take is that this explanation was evolved in ignorance\nof the fall of vegetable substances, or edible substances, in other\nparts of the world: that it is the familiar attempt to explain the\ngeneral in terms of the local; that, if we shall have data of falls of\nvegetable substance, in, say, Canada or India, they were not of lichens\nfrom the steppes of Asia Minor; that, though all falls in Asiatic Turkey\nand Persia are sweepingly and conveniently called showers of \"manna,\"\nthey have not been even all of the same substance. In one instance the\nparticles are said to have been \"seeds.\" Though, in _Comptes Rendus_,\nthe substance that fell in 1841 and 1846 is said to have been\ngelatinous, in the _Bull. Sci. Nat. de Neuchatel_, it is said to have\nbeen of something, in lumps the size of a filbert, that had been ground\ninto flour; that of this flour had been made bread, very\nattractive-looking, but flavorless. The great difficulty is to explain segregation in these showers--\n\nBut deep-sea fishes and occasional falls, down to them, of edible\nsubstances; bags of grain, barrels of sugar; things that had not been\nwhirled up from one part of the ocean-bottom, in storms or submarine\ndisturbances, and dropped somewhere else--\n\nI suppose one thinks--but grain in bags never has fallen--\n\nObject of Amherst--its covering like \"milled cloth\"--\n\nOr barrels of corn lost from a vessel would not sink--but a host of them\nclashing together, after a wreck--they burst open; the corn sinks, or\ndoes when saturated; the barrel staves float longer--\n\nIf there be not an overhead traffic in commodities similar to our own\ncommodities carried over this earth's oceans--I'm not the deep-sea fish\nI think I am. I have no data other than the mere suggestion of the Amherst object of\nbags or barrels, but my notion is that bags and barrels from a wreck on\none of this earth's oceans, would, by the time they reached the bottom,\nno longer be recognizable as bags or barrels; that, if we can have data\nof the fall of fibrous material that may have been cloth or paper or\nwood, we shall be satisfactory and grotesque enough. _Proc.

Irish Acad._, 1-379:\n\n\"In the year 1686, some workmen, who had been fetching water from a\npond, seven German miles from Memel, on returning to their work after\ndinner (during which there had been a snowstorm) found the flat ground\naround the pond covered with a coal-black, leafy mass; and a person who\nlived near said he had seen it fall like flakes with the snow.\"\n\nSome of these flake-like formations were as large as a table-top. \"The\nmass was damp and smelt disagreeably, like rotten seaweed, but, when\ndried, the smell went off.\"\n\n\"It tore fibrously, like paper.\"\n\nClassic explanation:\n\n\"Up from one place, and down in another.\"\n\nBut what went up, from one place, in a whirlwind? Of course, our\nIntermediatist acceptance is that had this been the strangest substance\nconceivable, from the strangest other world that could be thought of;\nsomewhere upon this earth there must be a substance similar to it, or\nfrom which it would, at least subjectively, or according to description,\nnot be easily distinguishable. Or that everything in New York City is\nonly another degree or aspect of something, or combination of things, in\na village of Central Africa. The novel is a challenge to vulgarization:\nwrite something that looks new to you: someone will point out that the\nthrice-accursed Greeks said it long ago. Existence is Appetite: the gnaw\nof being; the one attempt of all things to assimilate all other things,\nif they have not surrendered and submitted to some higher attempt. It\nwas cosmic that these scientists, who had surrendered to and submitted\nto the Scientific System, should, consistently with the principles of\nthat system, attempt to assimilate the substance that fell at Memel with\nsome known terrestrial product. At the meeting of the Royal Irish\nAcademy it was brought out that there is a substance, of rather rare\noccurrence, that has been known to form in thin sheets upon marsh land. It looks like greenish felt. The substance of Memel:\n\nDamp, coal-black, leafy mass. But, if broken up, the marsh-substance is flake-like, and it tears\nfibrously.

We knew, to start\nwith, that science and imbecility are continuous; nevertheless so many\nexpressions of the merging-point are at first startling. We did think\nthat Prof. Hitchcock's performance in identifying the Amherst phenomenon\nas a fungus was rather notable as scientific vaudeville, if we acquit\nhim of the charge of seriousness--or that, in a place where fungi were\nso common that, before a given evening two of them sprang up, only he, a\nstranger in this very fungiferous place, knew a fungus when he saw\nsomething like a fungus--if we disregard its quick liquefaction, for\ninstance. It was only a monologue, however: now we have an all-star\ncast: and they're not only Irish; they're royal Irish. The royal Irishmen excluded \"coal-blackness\" and included fibrousness:\nso then that this substance was \"marsh paper,\" which \"had been raised\ninto the air by storms of wind, and had again fallen.\"\n\nSecond act:\n\nIt was said that, according to M. Ehrenberg, \"the meteor-paper was found\nto consist partly of vegetable matter, chiefly of coniferv\u00e6.\"\n\nThird act:\n\nMeeting of the royal Irishmen: chairs, tables, Irishmen:\n\nSome flakes of marsh-paper were exhibited. Their composition was chiefly of coniferv\u00e6. This was a double inclusion: or it's the method of agreement that\nlogicians make so much of. So no logician would be satisfied with\nidentifying a peanut as a camel, because both have humps: he demands\naccessory agreement--that both can live a long time without water, for\ninstance. Now, it's not so very unreasonable, at least to the free and easy\nvaudeville standards that, throughout this book, we are considering, to\nthink that a green substance could be snatched up from one place in a\nwhirlwind, and fall as a black substance somewhere else: but the royal\nIrishmen excluded something else, and it is a datum that was as\naccessible to them as it is to me:\n\nThat, according to Chladni, this was no little, local deposition that\nwas seen to occur by some indefinite person living near a pond\nsomewhere. It was a tremendous fall from a vast sky-area. Likely enough all the marsh paper in the world could not have supplied\nit. At the same time, this substance was falling \"in great quantities,\" in\nNorway and Pomerania. Or see Kirkwood, _Meteoric Astronomy_, p. 66:\n\n\"Substance like charred paper fell in Norway and other parts of northern\nEurope, Jan. 31, 1686.\"\n\nOr a whirlwind, with a distribution as wide as that, would not\nacceptably, I should say, have so specialized in the rare substance\ncalled \"marsh paper.\" There'd have been falls of fence rails, roofs of\nhouses, parts of trees. Nothing is said of the occurrence of a tornado\nin northern Europe, in January, 1686. There is record only of this one\nsubstance having fallen in various places. Time went on, but the conventional determination to exclude data of all\nfalls to this earth, except of substances of this earth, and of ordinary\nmeteoric matter, strengthened. _Annals of Philosophy_, 16-68:\n\nThe substance that fell in January, 1686, is described as \"a mass of\nblack leaves, having the appearance of burnt paper, but harder, and\ncohering, and brittle.\"\n\n\"Marsh paper\" is not mentioned, and there is nothing said of the\n\"coniferv\u00e6,\" which seemed so convincing to the royal Irishmen. Vegetable\ncomposition is disregarded, quite as it might be by someone who might\nfind it convenient to identify a crook-necked squash as a big fishhook. Meteorites are usually covered with a black crust, more or less\nscale-like. The substance of 1686 is black and scale-like. If so be\nconvenience, \"leaf-likeness\" is \"scale-likeness.\" In this attempt to\nassimilate with the conventional, we are told that the substance is a\nmineral mass: that it is like the black scales that cover meteorites. The scientist who made this \"identification\" was Von Grotthus. He had\nappealed to the god Chemical Analysis. Or the power and glory of\nmankind--with which we're not always so impressed--but the gods must\ntell us what we want them to tell us. We see again that, though nothing\nhas identity of its own, anything can be \"identified\" as anything. Or\nthere's nothing that's not reasonable, if one snoopeth not into its\nexclusions. But here the conflict did not end. Berzelius examined the\nsubstance. He could not find nickel in it. At that time, the presence of\nnickel was the \"positive\" test of meteoritic matter. Whereupon, with a\nsupposititious \"positive\" standard of judgment against him, Von Grotthus\nrevoked his \"identification.\" (_Annals and Mag. of Nat. Hist._,\n1-3-185.)\n\nThis equalization of eminences permits us to project with our own\nexpression, which, otherwise, would be subdued into invisibility:\n\nThat it's too bad that no one ever looked to\nsee--hieroglyphics?--something written upon these sheets of paper? If we have no very great variety of substances that have fallen to this\nearth; if, upon this earth's surface there is infinite variety of\nsubstances detachable by whirlwinds, two falls of such a rare substance\nas marsh paper would be remarkable.",

If we have no very great variety of substances that have fallen to this\nearth; if, upon this earth's surface there is infinite variety of\nsubstances detachable by whirlwinds, two falls of such a rare substance\nas marsh paper would be remarkable. A writer in the _Edinburgh Review_, 87-194, says that, at the time of\nwriting, he had before him a portion of a sheet of 200 square feet, of a\nsubstance that had fallen at Carolath, Silesia, in 1839--exactly similar\nto cotton-felt, of which clothing might have been made. The god\nMicroscopic Examination had spoken. The substance consisted chiefly of\nconiferv\u00e6. _Jour. Asiatic Soc. of Bengal_, 1847-pt. 1-193:\n\nThat about 1846--about the time of a fall of edible substance in\nAsia Minor--an olive-gray powder fell at Shanghai. Under the microscope,\nit was seen to be an aggregation of hairs of two kinds, black ones and\nrather thick white ones. They were supposed to be mineral fibers, but,\nwhen burned, they gave out \"the common ammoniacal smell and smoke of\nburnt hair or feathers.\" The writer described the phenomenon as \"a cloud\nof 3800 square miles of fibers, alkali, and sand.\" In a postscript, he\nsays that other investigators, with more powerful microscopes, gave\nopinion that the fibers were not hairs; that the substance consisted\nchiefly of coniferv\u00e6. Or the pathos of it, perhaps; or the dull and uninspired, but courageous\npersistence of the scientific: everything seemingly found out is doomed\nto be subverted--by more powerful microscopes and telescopes; by more\nrefined, precise, searching means and methods--the new pronouncements\nirrepressibly bobbing up; their reception always as Truth at last;\nalways the illusion of the final; very little of the Intermediatist\nspirit--\n\nThat the new that has displaced the old will itself some day be\ndisplaced; that it, too, will be recognized as myth-stuff--\n\nBut that if phantoms climb, spooks of ladders are good enough for them. _Annual Register_, 1821-681:\n\nThat, according to a report by M. Lain\u00e9, French Consul at Pernambuco,\nearly in October, 1821, there was a shower of a substance resembling\nsilk. The quantity was as tremendous as might be a whole cargo, lost\nsomewhere between Jupiter and Mars, having drifted around perhaps for\ncenturies, the original fabrics slowly disintegrating. In _Annales de\nChimie_, 2-15-427, it is said that samples of this substance were sent\nto France by M. Lain\u00e9, and that they proved to have some resemblances to\nsilky filaments which, at certain times of the year, are carried by the\nwind near Paris. In the _Annals of Philosophy_, n.s., 12-93, there is mention of a\nfibrous substance like blue silk that fell near Naumberg, in the middle of the decade of the 1660s. According to Chladni (_Annales de Chimie_, 2-31-264), the quantity\nwas great. He places a question mark before the date. One of the advantages of Intermediatism is that, in the oneness of\nquasiness, there can be no mixed metaphors. Whatever is acceptable of\nanything, is, in some degree or aspect, acceptable of everything. So it\nis quite proper to speak, for instance, of something that is as firm as\na rock and that sails in a majestic march. The Irish are good monists:\nthey have of course been laughed at for their keener perceptions. So\nit's a book we're writing, or it's a procession, or it's a museum, with\nthe Chamber of Horrors rather over-emphasized. A rather horrible\ncorrelation occurs in the _Scientific American_, 1859-178. What\ninterests us is that a correspondent saw a silky substance fall from the\nsky--there was an aurora borealis at the time--he attributes the\nsubstance to the aurora. Since the time of Darwin, the classic explanation has been that all\nsilky substances that fall from the sky are spider webs. In 1832, aboard\nthe _Beagle_, at the mouth of La Plata River, 60 miles from land, Darwin\nsaw an enormous number of spiders, of the kind usually known as\n\"gossamer\" spiders, little aeronauts that cast out filaments by which\nthe wind carries them. It's difficult to express that silky substances that have fallen to this\nearth were not spider webs. My own acceptance is that spider webs are\nthe merger; that there have been falls of an externally derived silky\nsubstance, and also of the webs, or strands, rather, of aeronautic\nspiders indigenous to this earth; that in some instances it is\nimpossible to distinguish one from the other. Of course, our expression\nupon silky substances will merge away into expressions upon other\nseeming textile substances, and I don't know how much better off we'll\nbe--\n\nExcept that, if fabricable materials have fallen from the sky--\n\nSimply to establish acceptance of that may be doing well enough in this\nbook of first and tentative explorations. In _All the Year Round_, 8-254, is described a fall that took place in\nEngland, Sept. 21, 1741, in the towns of Bradly, Selborne, and\nAlresford, and in a triangular space included by these three towns.",

In _All the Year Round_, 8-254, is described a fall that took place in\nEngland, Sept. 21, 1741, in the towns of Bradly, Selborne, and\nAlresford, and in a triangular space included by these three towns. The\nsubstance is described as \"cobwebs\"--but it fell in flake-formation, or\nin \"flakes or rags about one inch broad and five or six inches long.\"\nAlso these flakes were of a relatively heavy substance--\"they fell with\nsome velocity.\" The quantity was great--the shortest side of the\ntriangular space is eight miles long. In the _Wernerian Nat. Hist. Soc. Trans._, 5-386, it is said that there were two falls--that they were\nsome hours apart--a datum that is becoming familiar to us--a datum that\ncannot be taken into the fold, unless we find it repeated over and over\nand over again. It is said that the second fall lasted from nine o'clock\nin the morning until night. Now the hypnosis of the classic--that what we call intelligence is only\nan expression of inequilibrium; that when mental adjustments are made,\nintelligence ceases--or, of course, that intelligence is the confession\nof ignorance. If you have intelligence upon any subject, that is\nsomething you're still learning--if we agree that that which is learned\nis always mechanically done--in quasi-terms, of course, because nothing\nis ever finally learned. It was decided that this substance was spiders' web. That was\nadjustment. But it's not adjustment to me; so I'm afraid I shall have\nsome intelligence in this matter. If I ever arrive at adjustment upon\nthis subject, then, upon this subject, I shall be able to have no\nthoughts, except routine-thoughts. I haven't yet quite decided\nabsolutely everything, so I am able to point out:\n\nThat this substance was of quantity so enormous that it attracted wide\nattention when it came down--\n\nThat it would have been equally noteworthy when it went up--\n\nThat there is no record of anyone, in England or elsewhere, having seen\ntons of \"spider webs\" going up, September, 1741. Further confession of intelligence upon my part:\n\nThat, if it be contested, then, that the place of origin may have been\nfar away, but still terrestrial--\n\nThen it's that other familiar matter of incredible \"marksmanship\"\nagain--hitting a small, triangular space for hours--interval of\nhours--then from nine in the morning until night: same small triangular\nspace. These are the disregards of the classic explanation. There is no mention\nof spiders having been seen to fall, but a good inclusion is that,\nthough this substance fell in good-sized flakes of considerable weight,\nit was viscous. In this respect it was like cobwebs: dogs nosing it on\ngrass, were blindfolded with it. This circumstance does strongly suggest\ncobwebs--\n\nUnless we can accept that, in regions aloft, there are vast viscous or\ngelatinous areas, and that things passing through become daubed. Or\nperhaps we clear up the confusion in the descriptions of the substance\nthat fell in 1841 and 1846, in Asia Minor, described in one publication\nas gelatinous, and in another as a cereal--that it was a cereal that had\npassed through a gelatinous region. That the paper-like substance of\nMemel may have had such an experience may be indicated in that Ehrenberg\nfound in it gelatinous matter, which he called \"nostoc.\" (_Annals and\nMag. of Nat. Hist._, 1-3-185.)\n\n_Scientific American_, 45-337:\n\nFall of a substance described as \"cobwebs,\" latter part of October,\n1881, in Milwaukee, Wis., and other towns: other towns mentioned are\nGreen Bay, Vesburge, Fort Howard, Sheboygan, and Ozaukee. The aeronautic\nspiders are known as \"gossamer\" spiders, because of the extreme\nlightness of the filaments that they cast out to the wind. Of the\nsubstance that fell in Wisconsin, it is said:\n\n\"In all instances the webs were strong in texture and very white.\"\n\nThe Editor says:\n\n\"Curiously enough, there is no mention in any of the reports that we\nhave seen, of the presence of spiders.\"\n\nSo our attempt to divorce a possible external product from its\nterrestrial merger: then our joy of the prospector who thinks he's found\nsomething:\n\nThe _Monthly Weather Review_, 26-566, quotes the _Montgomery_ (Ala.)\n_Advertiser_:\n\nThat, upon Nov. 21, 1898, numerous batches of spider-web-like substance\nfell in Montgomery, in strands and in occasional masses several inches\nlong and several inches broad. According to the writer, it was not\nspiders' web, but something like asbestos; also that it was\nphosphorescent. The Editor of the _Review_ says that he sees no reason for doubting that\nthese masses were cobwebs. _La Nature_, 1883-342:\n\nA correspondent writes that he sends a sample of a substance said to\nhave fallen at Montussan (Gironde), Oct. 16, 1883. According to a\nwitness, quoted by the correspondent, a thick cloud, accompanied by rain\nand a violent wind, had appeared. This cloud was composed of a woolly\nsubstance in lumps the size of a fist, which fell to the ground. The\nEditor (Tissandier) says of this substance that it was white, but was\nsomething that had been burned. It was fibrous. M. Tissandier astonishes\nus by saying that he cannot identify this substance. We thought that\nanything could be \"identified\" as anything. He can say only that the\ncloud in question must have been an extraordinary conglomeration.",

It was resinous and yellowish: so one\ninclines to the conventional explanation that it was pollen from pine\ntrees--but, when torn, it had the tenacity of cotton. When placed in\nwater, it had the consistency of resin. \"This resin had the color of\namber, was elastic, like India rubber, and smelled like prepared oil\nmixed with wax.\"\n\nSo in general our notion of cargoes--and our notion of cargoes of food\nsupplies:\n\nIn _Philosophical Transactions_, 19-224, is an extract from a letter by\nMr. Robert Vans, of Kilkenny, Ireland, dated Nov. 15, 1695: that there\nhad been \"of late,\" in the counties of Limerick and Tipperary, showers\nof a sort of matter like butter or grease... having \"a very stinking\nsmell.\"\n\nThere follows an extract from a letter by the Bishop of Cloyne, upon \"a\nvery odd phenomenon,\" which was observed in Munster and Leinster: that\nfor a good part of the spring of 1695 there fell a substance which the\ncountry people called \"butter\"--\"soft, clammy, and of a dark\nyellow\"--that cattle fed \"indifferently\" in fields where this substance\nlay. \"It fell in lumps as big as the end of one's finger.\" It had a \"strong\nill scent.\" His Grace calls it a \"stinking dew.\"\n\nIn Mr. Vans' letter, it is said that the \"butter\" was supposed to have\nmedicinal properties, and \"was gathered in pots and other vessels by\nsome of the inhabitants of this place.\"\n\nAnd:\n\nIn all the following volumes of _Philosophical Transactions_ there is no\nspeculation upon this extraordinary subject. Ostracism. The fate of this\ndatum is a good instance of damnation, not by denial, and not by\nexplaining away, but by simple disregard. The fall is listed by\nChladni, and is mentioned in other catalogues, but, from the absence of\nall inquiry, and of all but formal mention, we see that it has been\nunder excommunication as much as was ever anything by the preceding\nsystem. The datum has been buried alive. It is as irreconcilable with\nthe modern system of dogmas as ever were geologic strata and vermiform\nappendix with the preceding system--\n\nIf, intermittently, or \"for a good part of the spring,\" this substance\nfell in two Irish provinces, and nowhere else, we have, stronger than\nbefore, a sense of a stationary region overhead, or a region that\nreceives products like this earth's products, but from external sources,\na region in which this earth's gravitational and meteorological forces\nare relatively inert--if for many weeks a good part of this substance\ndid hover before finally falling. We suppose that, in 1685, Mr. Vans and\nthe Bishop of Cloyne could describe what they saw as well as could\nwitnesses in 1885: nevertheless, it is going far back; we shall have to\nhave many modern instances before we can accept. As to other falls, or another fall, it is said in the _Amer. Jour. Sci._, 1-28-361, that, about 1832--about a month after the fall of\nthe substance of Kourianof--fell a substance that was wine-yellow,\ntransparent, soft, and smelling like rancid oil. M. Herman, a chemist\nwho examined it, named it \"sky oil.\" For analysis and chemic reactions,\nsee the _Journal_. The _Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal_, 13-368,\nmentions an \"unctuous\" substance that fell near Rotterdam, in 1832. In\n_Comptes Rendus_, 13-215, there is an account of an oily, reddish matter\nthat fell at Genoa, February, 1841. Whatever it may have been--\n\nAltogether, most of our difficulties are problems that we should leave\nto later developers of super-geography, I think. A discoverer of America\nshould leave Long Island to someone else. If there be, plying back and\nforth from Jupiter and Mars and Venus, super-constructions that are\nsometimes wrecked, we think of fuel as well as cargoes. Of course the\nmost convincing data would be of coal falling from the sky:\nnevertheless, one does suspect that oil-burning engines were discovered\nages ago in more advanced worlds--but, as I say, we should leave\nsomething to our disciples--so we'll not especially wonder whether these\nbutter-like or oily substances were food or fuel. So we merely note that\nin the _Scientific American_, 24-323, is an account of hail that fell,\nin the middle of April, 1871, in Mississippi, in which was a substance\ndescribed as turpentine. Something that tasted like orange water, in hailstones, about the first\nof June, 1842, near N\u00eemes, France; identified as nitric acid (_Jour. de\nPharmacie_, 1845-273). Hail and ashes, in Ireland, 1755 (_Sci. Amer._, 5-168).

We are getting a little away from the lines of our composition, but it\nwill be an important point later that so many extraordinary falls have\noccurred with hail. Or--if they were of substances that had had origin\nupon some other part of this earth's surface--had the hail, too, that\norigin? Our acceptance here will depend upon the number of instances. Reasonably enough, some of the things that fall to this earth should\ncoincide with falls of hail. As to vegetable substances in quantities so great as to suggest lost\ncargoes, we have a note in the _Intellectual Observer_, 3-468: that,\nupon the first of May, 1863, a rain fell at Perpignan, \"bringing down\nwith it a red substance, which proved on examination to be a red meal\nmixed with fine sand.\" At various points along the Mediterranean, this\nsubstance fell. There is, in _Philosophical Transactions_, 16-281, an account of a\nseeming cereal, said to have fallen in Wiltshire, in 1686--said that\nsome of the \"wheat\" fell \"enclosed in hailstones\"--but the writer in\n_Transactions_, says that he had examined the grains, and that they were\nnothing but seeds of ivy berries dislodged from holes and chinks where\nbirds had hidden them. If birds still hide ivy seeds, and if winds still\nblow, I don't see why the phenomenon has not repeated in more than two\nhundred years since. Or the red matter in rain, at Siena, Italy, May, 1830; said, by Arago,\nto have been vegetable matter (Arago, _OEuvres_, 12-468). Somebody should collect data of falls at Siena alone. In the _Monthly Weather Review_, 29-465, a correspondent writes that,\nupon Feb. 16, 1901, at Pawpaw, Michigan, upon a day that was so calm\nthat his windmill did not run, fell a brown dust that looked like\nvegetable matter. The Editor of the _Review_ concludes that this was no\nwidespread fall from a tornado, because it had been reported from\nnowhere else. Rancidness--putridity--decomposition--a note that has been struck many\ntimes. In a positive sense, of course, nothing means anything, or every\nmeaning is continuous with all other meanings: or that all evidences of\nguilt, for instance, are just as good evidences of innocence--but this\ncondition seems to mean--things lying around among the stars a long\ntime. Horrible disaster in the time of Julius Caesar; remains from it\nnot reaching this earth till the time of the Bishop of Cloyne: we leave\nto later research the discussion of bacterial action and decomposition,\nand whether bacteria could survive in what we call space, of which we\nknow nothing--\n\n_Chemical News_, 35-183:\n\nDr. A.T. Machattie, F.C.S., writes that, at London, Ontario, Feb. 24,\n1868, in a violent storm, fell, with snow, a dark-colored substance,\nestimated at 500 tons, over a belt 50 miles by 10 miles. It was examined\nunder a microscope, by Dr. Machattie, who found it to consist mainly of\nvegetable matter \"far advanced in decomposition.\" The substance was\nexamined by Dr. James Adams, of Glasgow, who gave his opinion that it\nwas the remains of cereals. Dr. Machattie points out that for months\nbefore this fall the ground of Canada had been frozen, so that in this\ncase a more than ordinarily remote origin has to be thought of. Dr. Machattie thinks of origin to the south. \"However,\" he says, \"this is\nmere conjecture.\"\n\n_Amer. Jour. Sci._, 1841-40:\n\nThat, about 1840--during a thunderstorm--at Rajkit, India, occurred\na fall of grain. It was reported by Col. Sykes, of the British\nAssociation. The natives were greatly excited--because it was grain of a kind unknown\nto them. Usually comes forward a scientist who knows more of the things that\nnatives know best than the natives know--but it so happens that the\nusual thing was not done definitely in this instance:\n\n\"The grain was shown to some botanists, who did not immediately\nrecognize it, but thought it to be either a spartium or a vicia.\"\n\n\nLead, silver, diamonds, glass. They sound like the accursed, but they're not: they're now of the\nchosen--that is, when they occur in metallic or stony masses that\nScience has recognized as meteorites. We find that resistance is to\nsubstances not so mixed in or incorporated. Of accursed data, it seems to me that punk is pretty damnable. In the\n_Report of the British Association_, 1878-376, there is mention of a\nlight chocolate-brown substance that has fallen with meteorites. No\nparticulars given; not another mention anywhere else that I can find. In\nthis English publication, the word \"punk\" is not used; the substance is\ncalled \"amadou.\" I suppose, if the datum has anywhere been admitted to\nFrench publications, the word \"amadou\" has been avoided, and \"punk\"\nused. Or oneness of allness: scientific works and social registers: a\nGoldstein who can't get in as Goldstein, gets in as Jackson.",

The fall of sulphur from the sky has been especially repulsive to the\nmodern orthodoxy--largely because of its associations with the\nsuperstitions or principles of the preceding orthodoxy--stories of\ndevils: sulphurous exhalations. Several writers have said that they have\nhad this feeling. So the scientific reactionists, who have rabidly\nfought the preceding, because it was the preceding: and the scientific\nprudes, who, in sheer exclusionism, have held lean hands over pale eyes,\ndenying falls of sulphur. I have many notes upon the sulphurous odor of\nmeteorites, and many notes upon phosphorescence of things that come from\nexternality. Some day I shall look over old stories of demons that have\nappeared sulphurously upon this earth, with the idea of expressing that\nwe have often had undesirable visitors from other worlds; or that an\nindication of external derivation is sulphurousness. I expect some day\nto rationalize demonology, but just at present we are scarcely far\nenough advanced to go so far back. For a circumstantial account of a mass of burning sulphur, about the\nsize of a man's fist, that fell at Pultusk, Poland, Jan. 30, 1868, upon\na road, where it was stamped out by a crowd of villagers, see _Rept. Brit. Assoc._, 1874-272. The power of the exclusionists lies in that in their stand are combined\nboth modern and archaic systematists. Falls of sandstone and limestone\nare repulsive to both theologians and scientists. Sandstone and\nlimestone suggest other worlds upon which occur processes like\ngeological processes; but limestone, as a fossiliferous substance, is of\ncourse especially of the unchosen. In _Science_, late in the decade of the 1880s, we read of a block of limestone, said to\nhave fallen near Middleburg, Florida. It was exhibited at the\nSub-tropical Exposition, at Jacksonville. The writer, in _Science_,\ndenies that it fell from the sky. His reasoning is:\n\nThere is no limestone in the sky;\n\nTherefore this limestone did not fall from the sky. Better reasoning I cannot conceive of--because we see that a final major\npremise--universal--true--would include all things: that, then, would\nleave nothing to reason about--so then that all reasoning must be based\nupon \"something\" not universal, or only a phantom intermediate to the\ntwo finalities of nothingness and allness, or negativeness and\npositiveness. _La Nature_, 1890-2-127:\n\nFall, at Pel-et-Der (L'Aube), France, about 1890, of limestone\npebbles. Identified with limestone at Ch\u00e2teau-Landon--or up and down in\na whirlwind. But they fell with hail--which, in June, could not very\nwell be identified with ice from Ch\u00e2teau-Landon. Coincidence, perhaps. Upon page 70, _Science Gossip_, 1887, the Editor says, of a stone that\nwas reported to have fallen at Little Lever, England, that a sample had\nbeen sent to him. It was sandstone. Therefore it had not fallen, but had\nbeen on the ground in the first place. But, upon page 140, _Science\nGossip_, 1887, is an account of \"a large, smooth, water-worn, gritty\nsandstone pebble\" that had been found in the wood of a full-grown beech\ntree. Looks to me as if it had fallen red-hot, and had penetrated the\ntree with high velocity. But I have never heard of anything falling\nred-hot from a whirlwind--\n\nThe wood around this sandstone pebble was black, as if charred. Dr. Farrington, for instance, in his books, does not even mention\nsandstone. However, the British Association, though reluctant, is less\nexclusive: _Report_ of 1860, p. 197: substance about the size of a\nduck's egg, that fell at Raphoe, Ireland, about 1860--date questioned. It is not definitely said that this substance was sandstone, but that it\n\"resembled\" friable sandstone. Falls of salt have occurred often. They have been avoided by\nscientific writers, because of the dictum that only water and\nnot substances held in solution, can be raised by evaporation. However, falls of salty water have received attention from\nDalton and others, and have been attributed to whirlwinds from the sea. This is so reasonably contested--quasi-reasonably--as to places not\nfar from the sea--\n\nBut the fall of salt that occurred high in the mountains of\nSwitzerland--\n\nWe could have predicted that that datum could be found somewhere. Let\nanything be explained in local terms of the coast of England--but also\nhas it occurred high in the mountains of Switzerland. Large crystals of salt fell--in a hailstorm--Aug. 20, 1870, in\nSwitzerland. The orthodox explanation is a crime: whoever made it,\nshould have had his finger-prints taken. We are told (_An. Rec. Sci._,\n1872) that these objects of salt \"came over the Mediterranean from some\npart of Africa.\"\n\nOr the hypnosis of the conventional--provided it be glib. One reads such\nan assertion, and provided it be suave and brief and conventional, one\nseldom questions--or thinks \"very strange\" and then forgets. One has an\nimpression from geography lessons: Mediterranean not more than three\ninches wide, on the map; Switzerland only a few more inches away. These\nsizable masses of salt are described in the _Amer. Jour. Sci._, 3-3-239,\nas \"essentially imperfect cubic crystals of common salt.\" As to\noccurrence with hail--that can in one, or ten, or twenty, instances be\ncalled a coincidence.

Another datum: extraordinary year 1883:\n\nLondon _Times_, Dec. 25, 1883:\n\nTranslation from a Turkish newspaper; a substance that fell at Scutari,\nDec. 2, 1883; described as an unknown substance, in particles--or\nflakes?--like snow. \"It was found to be saltish to the taste, and to\ndissolve readily in water.\"\n\nMiscellaneous:\n\n\"Black, capillary matter\" that fell, Nov. 16, 1857, at Charleston, S.C. (_Amer. Jour. Sci._, 2-31-459). Fall of small, friable, vesicular masses, from size of a pea to size of\na walnut, at Lobau, Jan. 18, 1835 (_Rept. Brit. Assoc._, 1860-85). Objects that fell at Peshawur, India, June, 1893, during a storm:\nsubstance that looked like crystallized niter, and that tasted like\nsugar (_Nature_, about 1893). I suppose sometimes deep-sea fishes have their noses bumped by cinders. If their regions be subjacent to Cunard or White Star routes, they're\nespecially likely to be bumped. I conceive of no inquiry: they're\ndeep-sea fishes. Or the slag of Slains. That it was a furnace-product. The Rev. James\nRust seemed to feel bumped. He tried in vain to arouse inquiry. As to a report, from Chicago, about 1870s, that slag had fallen from\nthe sky, Prof. E.S. Bastian (_Amer. Jour. Sci._, 3-18-78) says that the\nslag \"had been on the ground in the first place.\" It was furnace-slag. \"A chemical examination of the specimens has shown that they possess\nnone of the characteristics of true meteorites.\"\n\nOver and over and over again, the universal delusion; hope and despair\nof attempted positivism; that there can be real criteria, or distinct\ncharacteristics of anything. If anybody can define--not merely suppose,\nlike Prof. Bastian, that he can define--the true characteristics of\nanything, or so localize trueness anywhere, he makes the discovery for\nwhich the cosmos is laboring. He will be instantly translated, like\nElijah, into the Positive Absolute. My own notion is that, in a moment\nof super-concentration, Elijah became so nearly a real prophet that he\nwas translated to heaven, or to the Positive Absolute, with such\nvelocity that he left an incandescent train behind him. As we go along,\nwe shall find the \"true test of meteoritic material,\" which in the past\nhas been taken as an absolute, dissolving into almost utmost nebulosity. Prof. Bastian explains mechanically, or in terms of the usual reflexes\nto all reports of unwelcome substances: that near where the slag had\nbeen found, telegraph wires had been struck by lightning; that particles\nof melted wire had been seen to fall near the slag--which had been on\nthe ground in the first place. But, according to the _New York Times_,\nabout 1879, about two bushels of this substance had fallen. Something that was said to have fallen at Darmstadt, about 1846;\nlisted by Greg (_Rept. Brit. Assoc._, 1867-416) as \"only slag.\"\n\n_Philosophical Magazine_, 4-10-381:\n\nThat, in 1855, a large stone was found far in the interior of a tree, in\nBattersea Fields. Sometimes cannon balls are found embedded in trees. Doesn't seem to be\nanything to discuss; doesn't seem discussable that any one would cut a\nhole in a tree and hide a cannon ball, which one could take to bed, and\nhide under one's pillow, just as easily. So with the stone of Battersea\nFields. What is there to say, except that it fell with high velocity and\nembedded in the tree? Nevertheless, there was a great deal of\ndiscussion--\n\nBecause, at the foot of the tree, as if broken off the stone, fragments\nof slag were found. I have nine other instances. Slag and cinders and ashes, and you won't believe, and neither will I,\nthat they came from the furnaces of vast aerial super-constructions. We'll see what looks acceptable. As to ashes, the difficulties are great, because we'd expect many falls\nof terrestrially derived ashes--volcanoes and forest fires. In some of our acceptances, I have felt a little radical--\n\nI suppose that one of our main motives is to show that there is, in\nquasi-existence, nothing but the preposterous--or something intermediate\nto absolute preposterousness and final reasonableness--that the new is\nthe obviously preposterous; that it becomes the established and\ndisguisedly preposterous; that it is displaced, after a while, and is\nagain seen to be the preposterous. Or that all progress is from the\noutrageous to the academic or sanctified, and back to the\noutrageous--modified, however, by a trend of higher and higher\napproximation to the impreposterous. Sometimes I feel a little more\nuninspired than at other times, but I think we're pretty well accustomed\nnow to the oneness of allness; or that the methods of science in\nmaintaining its system are as outrageous as the attempts of the damned\nto break in. In the _Annual Record of Science_, 1875-241, Prof. Daubr\u00e9e\nis quoted: that ashes that had fallen in the Azores had come from the\nChicago fire--\n\nOr the damned and the saved, and there's little to choose between them;\nand angels are beings that have not obviously barbed tails to them--or\nnever have such bad manners as to stroke an angel below the waist-line.",

However this especial outrage was challenged: the Editor of the _Record_\nreturns to it, in the issue of 1876: considers it \"in the highest degree\nimproper to say that the ashes of Chicago were landed in the Azores.\"\n\n_Bull. Soc. Astro. de France_, 22-245:\n\nAccount of a white substance, like ashes, that fell at Annoy, France,\nlate in the decade of the 1900s: simply called a curious phenomenon; no attempt to trace\nto a terrestrial source. Flake formations, which may signify passage through a region of\npressure, are common; but spherical formations--as if of things that\nhave rolled and rolled along planar regions somewhere--are commoner:\n\n_Nature_, Jan. 10, 1884, quotes a Kimberley newspaper:\n\nThat, toward the close of November, 1883, a thick shower of ashy matter\nfell at Queenstown, South Africa. The matter was in marble-sized balls,\nwhich were soft and pulpy, but which, upon drying, crumbled at touch. The shower was confined to one narrow streak of land. It would be only\nordinarily preposterous to attribute this substance to Krakatoa--\n\nBut, with the fall, loud noises were heard--\n\nBut I'll omit many notes upon ashes: if ashes should sift down upon\ndeep-sea fishes, that is not to say that they came from steamships. Data of falls of cinders have been especially damned by Mr. Symons, the\nmeteorologist, some of whose investigations we'll investigate\nlater--nevertheless--\n\nNotice of a fall, in Victoria, Australia, about 1875 (_Rept. Brit. Assoc._, 1875-242)--at least we are told, in the reluctant way, that\nsomeone \"thought\" he saw matter fall near him at night, and the next day\nfound something that looked like cinders. In the _Proc. of the London Roy. Soc._, 19-122, there is an account of\ncinders that fell on the deck of a lightship, Jan. 9, 1873. In the\n_Amer. Jour. Sci._, 2-24-449, there is a notice that the Editor had\nreceived a specimen of cinders said to have fallen--in showery\nweather--upon a farm, near Ottowa, Ill., Jan. 17, 1857. But after all, ambiguous things they are, cinders or ashes or slag or\nclinkers, the high priest of the accursed that must speak aloud for us\nis--coal that has fallen from the sky. Or coke:\n\nThe person who thought he saw something like cinders, also thought he\nsaw something like coke, we are told. _Nature_, 36-119:\n\nSomething that \"looked exactly like coke\" that fell--during a\nthunderstorm--in the Orne, France, about 1887. Or charcoal:\n\nDr. Angus Smith, in the _Lit. and Phil. Soc. of Manchester Memoirs_,\n2-9-146, says that, about 1827--like a great deal in Lyell's\n_Principles_ and Darwin's _Origin_, this account is from\nhearsay--something fell from the sky, near Allport, England. It fell\nluminously, with a loud report, and scattered in a field. A fragment\nthat was seen by Dr. Smith, is described by him as having \"the\nappearance of a piece of common wood charcoal.\" Nevertheless, the\nreassured feeling of the faithful, upon reading this, is burdened with\ndata of differences: the substance was so uncommonly heavy that it\nseemed as if it had iron in it; also there was \"a sprinkling of\nsulphur.\" This material is said, by Prof. Baden-Powell, to be \"totally\nunlike that of any other meteorite.\" Greg, in his catalogue (_Rept. Brit. Assoc._, 1860-73), calls it \"a more than doubtful substance\"--but\nagain, against reassurance, that is not doubt of authenticity. Greg says\nthat it is like compact charcoal, with particles of sulphur and iron\npyrites embedded. Reassurance rises again:\n\nProf. Baden-Powell says: \"It contains also charcoal, which might perhaps\nbe acquired from matter among which it fell.\"\n\nThis is a common reflex with the exclusionists: that substances not\n\"truly meteoritic\" did not fall from the sky, but were picked up by\n\"truly meteoritic\" things, of course only on their surfaces, by impact\nwith this earth. Rhythm of reassurances and their declines:\n\nAccording to Dr. Smith, this substance was not merely coated with\ncharcoal; his analysis gives 43.59 per cent carbon. Our acceptance that coal has fallen from the sky will be via data of\nresinous substances and bituminous substances, which merge so that they\ncannot be told apart. Resinous substance said to have fallen at Kaba, Hungary, late in the decade of the 1880s\n(_Rept. Brit. Assoc._, 1860-94). A resinous substance that fell after a fireball? at Neuhaus, Bohemia,\nDec. 17, 1824 (_Rept. Brit. Assoc._, 1860-70). Fall, about 1885, at Luchon, during a storm, of a brownish substance;\nvery friable, carbonaceous matter; when burned it gave out a resinous\nodor (_Comptes Rendus_, 103-837). Substance that fell, Feb. 17, 18, 19, 1841, at Genoa, Italy, said to\nhave been resinous; said by Arago (_OEuvres_, 12-469) to have been\nbituminous matter and sand.

Lockyer\n(_The Meteoric Hypothesis_, p. 24) says that the substance that fell at\nthe Cape of Good Hope, Oct. 13, 1838--about five cubic feet of it:\nsubstance so soft that it was cuttable with a knife--\"after being\nexperimented upon, it left a residue, which gave out a very bituminous\nsmell.\"\n\nAnd this inclusion of Lockyer's--so far as findable in all books that I\nhave read--is, in books, about as close as we can get to our\ndesideratum--that coal has fallen from the sky. Dr. Farrington, except\nwith a brief mention, ignores the whole subject of the fall of\ncarbonaceous matter from the sky. Proctor, in all of his books that I\nhave read--is, in books, about as close as we can get to the admission\nthat carbonaceous matter has been found in meteorites \"in very minute\nquantities\"--or my own suspicion is that it is possible to damn\nsomething else only by losing one's own soul--quasi-soul, of course. _Sci. Amer._, 35-120:\n\nThat the substance that fell at the Cape of Good Hope \"resembled a piece\nof anthracite coal more than anything else.\"\n\nIt's a mistake, I think: the resemblance is to bituminous coal--but it\nis from the periodicals that we must get our data. To the writers of\nbooks upon meteorites, it would be as wicked--by which we mean departure\nfrom the characters of an established species--quasi-established, of\ncourse--to say that coal has fallen from the sky, as would be, to\nsomething in a barnyard, a temptation that it climb a tree and catch a\nbird. Domestic things in a barnyard: and how wild things from forests\noutside seem to them. Or the homeopathist--but we shall shovel data of\ncoal. And, if over and over, we shall learn of masses of soft coal that have\nfallen upon this earth, if in no instance has it been asserted that the\nmasses did not fall, but were upon the ground in the first place; if we\nhave many instances, this time we turn down good and hard the mechanical\nreflex that these masses were carried from one place to another in\nwhirlwinds, because we find it too difficult to accept that whirlwinds\ncould so select, or so specialize in a peculiar substance. Among writers\nof books, the only one I know of who makes more than brief mention is\nSir Robert Ball. He represents a still more antique orthodoxy, or is an\nexclusionist of the old type, still holding out against even meteorites. He cites several falls of carbonaceous matter, but with disregards that\nmake for reasonableness that earthy matter may have been caught up by\nwhirlwinds and flung down somewhere else. If he had given a full list,\nhe would be called upon to explain the special affinity of whirlwinds\nfor a special kind of coal. He does not give a full list. We shall have\nall that's findable, and we shall see that against this disease we're\nwriting, the homeopathist's prescription availeth not. Another\nexclusionist was Prof. Lawrence Smith. His psycho-tropism was to\nrespond to all reports of carbonaceous matter falling from the sky, by\nsaying that this damned matter had been deposited upon things of the\nchosen by impact with this earth. Most of our data antedate him, or were\ncontemporaneous with him, or were as accessible to him as to us. In his\nattempted positivism it is simply--and beautifully--disregarded that,\naccording to Berthelot, Berzelius, Cloez, Wohler and others these masses\nare not merely coated with carbonaceous matter, but are carbonaceous\nthroughout, or are permeated throughout. How anyone could so resolutely\nand dogmatically and beautifully and blindly hold out would puzzle us\nwere it not for our acceptance that only to think is to exclude and\ninclude; and to exclude some things that have as much right to come in\nas have the included--that to have an opinion upon any subject is to be\na Lawrence Smith--because there is no definite subject. Dr. Walter Flight (_Eclectic Magazine_, 89-71) says, of the substance\nthat fell near Alais, France, in the middle of the decade of the 1800s, that it \"emits a faint\nbituminous substance\" when heated, according to the observations of\nBergelius and a commission appointed by the French Academy.

Daubr\u00e9e, the substance that had fallen in the\nArgentine Republic, \"resembled certain kinds of lignite and boghead\ncoal.\" In _Comptes Rendus_, 96-1764, it is said that this mass fell,\nabout 1880, in the province Entre R\u00edos, Argentina: that it is \"like\"\nbrown coal; that it resembles all the other carbonaceous masses that\nhave fallen from the sky. Something that fell at Grazac, France, Aug. 10, 1885: when burned, it\ngave out a bituminous odor (_Comptes Rendus_, 104-1771). Carbonaceous substance that fell at Rajpunta, India, Jan. 22, 1911: very\nfriable: 50 per cent of its soluble in water (_Records Geol. Survey of\nIndia_, 44-pt. 1-41). A combustible carbonaceous substance that fell with sand at Naples,\nabout 1818 (_Amer. Jour. Sci._, 1-1-309). _Sci. Amer. Sup._, 29-11798:\n\nThat, about 1889, a very friable substance, of a deep, greenish black,\nfell at Mighei, Russia. It contained 5 per cent organic matter, which,\nwhen powdered and digested in alcohol, yielded, after evaporation, a\nbright yellow resin. In this mass was 2 per cent of an unknown mineral. Cinders and ashes and slag and coke and charcoal and coal. And the things that sometimes deep-sea fishes are bumped by. Reluctances and the disguises or covered retreats of such words as\n\"like\" and \"resemble\"--or that conditions of Intermediateness forbid\nabrupt transitions--but that the spirit animating all Intermediateness\nis to achieve abrupt transitions--because, if anything could finally\nbreak away from its origin and environment, that would be a real\nthing--something not merging away indistinguishably with the\nsurrounding. So all attempt to be original; all attempt to invent\nsomething that is more than mere extension or modification of the\npreceding, is positivism--or that if one could conceive of a device to\ncatch flies, positively different from, or unrelated to, all other\ndevices--up he'd shoot to heaven, or the Positive Absolute--leaving\nbehind such an incandescent train that in one age it would be said that\nhe had gone aloft in a fiery chariot, and in another age that he had\nbeen struck by lightning--\n\nI'm collecting notes upon persons supposed to have been struck by\nlightning. I think that high approximation to positivism has often been\nachieved--instantaneous translation--residue of negativeness left\nbehind, looking much like effects of a stroke of lightning. Some day I\nshall tell the story of the _Marie Celeste_--\"properly,\" as the\n_Scientific American Supplement_ would say--mysterious disappearance of\na sea captain, his family, and the crew--\n\nOf positivists, by the route of Abrupt Transition, I think that Manet\nwas notable--but that his approximation was held down by his intense\nrelativity to the public--or that it is quite as impositive to flout and\ninsult and defy as it is to crawl and placate. Of course, Manet began\nwith continuity with Courbet and others, and then, between him and Manet\nthere were mutual influences--but the spirit of abrupt difference is the\nspirit of positivism, and Manet's stand was against the dictum that all\nlights and shades must merge away suavely into one another and prepare\nfor one another. So a biologist like De Vries represents positivism, or\nthe breaking of Continuity, by trying to conceive of evolution by\nmutation--against the dogma of indistinguishable gradations by \"minute\nvariations.\" A Copernicus conceives of helio-centricity. Continuity is\nagainst him. He is not permitted to break abruptly with the past. He is\npermitted to publish his work, but only as \"an interesting hypothesis.\"\n\nContinuity--and that all that we call evolution or progress is attempt\nto break away from it--\n\nThat our whole solar system was at one time attempt by planets to break\naway from a parental nexus and set up as individualities, and, failing,\nmove in quasi-regular orbits that are expressions of relations with the\nsun and with one another, all having surrendered, being now\nquasi-incorporated in a higher approximation to system:\n\nIntermediateness in its mineralogic aspect of positivism--or Iron that\nstrove to break away from Sulphur and Oxygen, and be real, homogeneous\nIron--failing, inasmuch as elemental iron exists only in text-book\nchemistry:\n\nIntermediateness in its biologic aspect of positivism--or the wild,\nfantastic, grotesque, monstrous things it conceived of, sometimes in a\nfrenzy of effort to break away abruptly from all preceding types--but\nfailing, in the giraffe-effort, for instance, or only caricaturing an\nantelope--\n\nAll things break one relation only by the establishing of some other\nrelation--\n\nAll things cut an umbilical cord only to clutch a breast. So the fight of the exclusionists to maintain the traditional--or to\nprevent abrupt transition from the quasi-established--fighting so that\nhere, more than a century after meteorites were included, no other\nnotable inclusion has been made, except that of cosmic dust, data of\nwhich Nordenskiold made more nearly real than data in opposition. So Proctor, for instance, fought and expressed his feeling of the\npreposterous, against Sir W.H.",

So Proctor, for instance, fought and expressed his feeling of the\npreposterous, against Sir W.H. Thomson's notions of arrival upon this\nearth of organisms on meteorites--\n\n\"I can only regard it as a jest\" (_Knowledge_, 1-302). Or that there is nothing but jest--or something intermediate to jest and\ntragedy:\n\nThat ours is not an existence but an utterance;\n\nThat Momus is imagining us for the amusement of the gods, often with\nsuch success that some of us seem almost alive--like characters in\nsomething a novelist is writing; which often to considerable degree take\ntheir affairs away from the novelist--\n\nThat Momus is imagining us and our arts and sciences and religions, and\nis narrating or picturing us as a satire upon the gods' real existence. Because--with many of our data of coal that has fallen from the sky as\naccessible then as they are now, and with the scientific pronouncement\nthat coal is fossil, how, in a real existence, by which we mean a\nconsistent existence, or a state in which there is real intelligence, or\na form of thinking that does not indistinguishably merge away with\nimbecility, could there have been such a row as that which was raised\nabout forty years ago over Dr. Hahn's announcement that he had found\nfossils in meteorites? Accessible to anybody at that time:\n\n_Philosophical Magazine_, 4-17-425:\n\nThat the substance that fell at Kaba, Hungary, late in the decade of the 1850s, contained\norganic matter \"analagous to fossil waxes.\"\n\nOr limestone:\n\nOf the block of limestone which was reported to have fallen at\nMiddleburg, Florida, it is said (_Science_, 11-118) that, though\nsomething had been seen to fall in \"an old cultivated field,\" the\nwitnesses who ran to it picked up something that \"had been upon the\nground in the first place.\" The writer who tells us this, with the usual\nexclusion-imagination known as stupidity, but unjustly, because there is\nno real stupidity, thinks he can think of a good-sized stone that had\nfor many years been in a cultivated field, but that had never been seen\nbefore--had never interfered with plowing, for instance. He is earnest\nand unjarred when he writes that this stone weighs 200 pounds. My own\nnotion, founded upon my own experience in seeing, is that a block of\nstone weighing 500 pounds might be in one's parlor twenty years,\nvirtually unseen--but not in an old cultivated field, where it\ninterfered with plowing--not anywhere--if it interfered. Dr. Hahn said that he had found fossils in meteorites. There is a\ndescription of the corals, sponges, shells, and crinoids, all of them\nmicroscopic, which he photographed, in _Popular Science_, 20-83. Dr. Hahn was a well-known scientist. He was better known after that. Anybody may theorize upon other worlds and conditions upon them that are\nsimilar to our own conditions: if his notions be presented undisguisedly\nas fiction, or only as an \"interesting hypothesis,\" he'll stir up no\nprude rages. But Dr. Hahn said definitely that he had found fossils in specified\nmeteorites: also he published photographs of them. His book is in the\nNew York Public Library. In the reproductions every feature of some of\nthe little shells is plainly marked. If they're not shells, neither are\nthings under an oyster-counter. The striations are very plain: one sees\neven the hinges where bivalves are joined. Prof. Lawrence Smith (_Knowledge_, 1-258):\n\n\"Dr. Hahn is a kind of half-insane man, whose imagination has run away\nwith him.\"\n\nConservation of Continuity. Then Dr. Weinland examined Dr. Hahn's specimens. He gave his opinion\nthat they are fossils and that they are not crystals of enstatite, as\nasserted by Prof. Smith, who had never seen them. The damnation of denial and the damnation of disregard:\n\nAfter the publication of Dr. Weinland's findings--silence. The living things that have come down to this earth:\n\nAttempts to preserve the system:\n\nThat small frogs and toads, for instance, never have fallen from the\nsky, but were--\"on the ground, in the first place\"; or that there have\nbeen such falls--\"up from one place in a whirlwind, and down in\nanother.\"\n\nWere there some especially froggy place near Europe, as there is an\nespecially sandy place, the scientific explanation would of course be\nthat all small frogs falling from the sky in Europe come from that\ncenter of frogeity. To start with, I'd like to emphasize something that I am permitted to\nsee because I am still primitive or intelligent or in a state of\nmaladjustment:\n\nThat there is not one report findable of a fall of tadpoles from the\nsky. As to \"there in the first place\":\n\nSee _Leisure Hours_, 3-779, for accounts of small frogs, or toads, said\nto have been seen to fall from the sky.

To start with I do not deny--positively--the conventional explanation of\n\"up and down.\" I think that there may have been such occurrences. I omit\nmany notes that I have upon indistinguishables. In the London _Times_,\nabout 1883, there is an account of a shower of twigs and leaves and\ntiny toads in a storm upon the slopes of the Apennines. These may have\nbeen the ejectamenta of a whirlwind. I add, however, that I have notes\nupon two other falls of tiny toads, in 1883, one in France and one in\nTahiti; also of fish in Scotland. But in the phenomenon of the\nApennines, the mixture seems to me to be typical of the products of a\nwhirlwind. The other instances seem to me to be typical of--something\nlike migration? Their great numbers and their homogeneity. Over and over\nin these annals of the damned occurs the datum of segregation. But a\nwhirlwind is thought of as a condition of chaos--quasi-chaos: not final\nnegativeness, of course--\n\n_Monthly Weather Review_, July, 1881:\n\n\"A small pond in the track of the cloud was sucked dry, the water being\ncarried over the adjoining fields together with a large quantity of soft\nmud, which was scattered over the ground for half a mile around.\"\n\nIt is so easy to say that small frogs that have fallen from the sky had\nbeen scooped up by a whirlwind; but here are the circumstances of a\nscoop; in the exclusionist-imagination there is no regard for mud,\nd\u00e9bris from the bottom of a pond, floating vegetation, loose things from\nthe shores--but a precise picking out of frogs only. Of all instances I\nhave that attribute the fall of small frogs or toads to whirlwinds, only\none definitely identifies or places the whirlwind. Also, as has been\nsaid before, a pond going up would be quite as interesting as frogs\ncoming down. Whirlwinds we read of over and over--but where and what\nwhirlwind? It seems to me that anybody who had lost a pond would be\nheard from. In _Symons' Meteorological Magazine_, 32-106, a fall of\nsmall frogs, near Birmingham, England, about 1892, is attributed to a\nspecific whirlwind--but not a word as to any special pond that had\ncontributed. And something that strikes my attention here is that these\nfrogs are described as almost white. I'm afraid there is no escape for us: we shall have to give to\ncivilization upon this earth--some new worlds. Places with white frogs in them. Upon several occasions we have had data of unknown things that have\nfallen from--somewhere. But something not to be overlooked is that if\nliving things have landed alive upon this earth--in spite of all we\nthink we know of the accelerative velocity of falling bodies--and have\npropagated--why the exotic becomes the indigenous, or from the strangest\nof places we'd expect the familiar. Or if hosts of living frogs have\ncome here--from somewhere else--every living thing upon this earth may,\nancestrally, have come from--somewhere else. I find that I have another note upon a specific hurricane:\n\n_Annals and Mag. of Nat. Hist._, 1-3-185:\n\nAfter one of the greatest hurricanes in the history of Ireland, some\nfish were found \"as far as 15 yards from the edge of a lake.\"\n\nHave another: this is a good one for the exclusionists:\n\nFall of fish in Paris: said that a neighboring pond had been blown dry. (_Living Age_, 52-186.) Date not given, but I have seen it recorded\nsomewhere else. The best-known fall of fishes from the sky is that which occurred at\nMountain Ash, in the Valley of Abedare, Glamorganshire, Feb. 11, 1859. The Editor of the _Zoologist_, 2-677, having published a report of a\nfall of fishes, writes: \"I am continually receiving similar accounts of\nfrogs and fishes.\" But, in all the volumes of the _Zoologist_, I can\nfind only two reports of such falls. There is nothing to conclude other\nthan that hosts of data have been lost because orthodoxy does not look\nfavorably upon such reports. The _Monthly Weather Review_ records\nseveral falls of fishes in the United States; but accounts of these\nreported occurrences are not findable in other American publications. Nevertheless, the treatment by the _Zoologist_ of the fall reported from\nMountain Ash is fair. First appears, in the issue of 1859-6493, a letter\nfrom the Rev. John Griffith, Vicar of Abedare, asserting that the fall\nhad occurred, chiefly upon the property of Mr. Nixon, of Mountain Ash. Upon page 6540, Dr. Gray, of the British Museum, bristling with\nexclusionism, writes that some of these fishes, which had been sent to\nhim alive, were \"very young minnows.\" He says: \"On reading the evidence,\nit seems to me most probably only a practical joke: that one of Mr.",

Upon page 6540, Dr. Gray, of the British Museum, bristling with\nexclusionism, writes that some of these fishes, which had been sent to\nhim alive, were \"very young minnows.\" He says: \"On reading the evidence,\nit seems to me most probably only a practical joke: that one of Mr. Nixon's employees had thrown a pailful of water upon another, who had\nthought fish in it had fallen from the sky\"--had dipped up a pailful\nfrom a brook. Those fishes--still alive--were exhibited at the Zoological Gardens,\nRegent's Park. The Editor says that one was a minnow and that the rest\nwere sticklebacks. He says that Dr. Gray's explanation is no doubt right. But, upon page 6564, he publishes a letter from another correspondent,\nwho apologizes for opposing \"so high an authority as Dr. Gray,\" but says\nthat he had obtained some of these fishes from persons who lived at a\nconsiderable distance apart, or considerably out of range of the playful\npail of water. According to the _Annual Register_, 1859-14, the fishes themselves had\nfallen by pailfuls. If these fishes were not upon the ground in the first place, we base our\nobjections to the whirlwind explanation upon two data:\n\nThat they fell in no such distribution as one could attribute to the\ndischarge of a whirlwind, but upon a narrow strip of land: about 80\nyards long and 12 yards wide--\n\nThe other datum is again the suggestion that at first seemed so\nincredible, but for which support is piling up, a suggestion of a\nstationary source overhead--\n\nThat ten minutes later another fall of fishes occurred upon this same\nnarrow strip of land. Even arguing that a whirlwind may stand still axially, it discharges\ntangentially. Wherever the fishes came from it does not seem thinkable\nthat some could have fallen and that others could have whirled even a\ntenth of a minute, then falling directly after the first to fall. Because of these evil circumstances the best adaptation was to laugh the\nwhole thing off and say that someone had soused someone else with a\npailful of water in which a few \"very young\" minnows had been caught up. In the London _Times_, about 1859, is a letter from Mr. Aaron\nRoberts, curate of St. Peter's, Carmathon. In this letter the fishes are\nsaid to have been about four inches long, but there is some question of\nspecies. I think, myself, that they were minnows and sticklebacks. Some\npersons, thinking them to be sea fishes, placed them in salt water,\naccording to Mr. Roberts. \"The effect is stated to have been almost\ninstantaneous death.\" \"Some were placed in fresh water. These seemed to\nthrive well.\" As to narrow distribution, we are told that the fishes\nfell \"in and about the premises of Mr. Nixon.\" \"It was not observed at\nthe time that any fish fell in any other part of the neighborhood, save\nin the particular spot mentioned.\"\n\nIn the London _Times_, about 1859, Vicar Griffith writes an account:\n\n\"The roofs of some houses were covered with them.\"\n\nIn this letter it is said that the largest fishes were five inches long,\nand that these did not survive the fall. _Report of the British Association_, 1859-158:\n\n\"The evidence of the fall of fish on this occasion was very conclusive. A specimen of the fish was exhibited and was found to be the\n_Gasterosteus leirus_.\"\n\n_Gasterosteus_ is the stickleback. Altogether I think we have not a sense of total perdition, when we're\ndamned with the explanation that someone soused someone else with a\npailful of water in which were thousands of fishes four or five inches\nlong, some of which covered roofs of houses, and some of which remained\nten minutes in the air. By way of contrast we offer our own acceptance:\n\nThat the bottom of a super-geographical pond had dropped out. I have a great many notes upon the fall of fishes, despite the\ndifficulty these records have in getting themselves published, but I\npick out the instances that especially relate to our super-geographical\nacceptances, or to the Principles of Super-Geography: or data of things\nthat have been in the air longer than acceptably could a whirlwind carry\nthem; that have fallen with a distribution narrower than is attributable\nto a whirlwind; that have fallen for a considerable length of time upon\nthe same narrow area of land. These three factors indicate, somewhere not far aloft, a region of\ninertness to this earth's gravitation, of course, however, a region\nthat, by the flux and variation of all things, must at times be\nsusceptible--but, afterward, our heresy will bifurcate--\n\nIn amiable accommodation to the crucifixion it'll get, I think--\n\nBut so impressed are we with the datum that, though there have been many\nreports of small frogs that have fallen from the sky, not one report\nupon a fall of tadpoles is findable, that to these circumstances another\nadjustment must be made.

The devotees of St. Isaac explain that they fall upon thick grass and so survive: but Sir\nJames Emerson Tennant, in his _History of Ceylon_, tells of a fall of\nfishes upon gravel, by which they were seemingly uninjured. Something\nelse apart from our three main interests is a phenomenon that looks like\nwhat one might call an alternating series of falls of fishes, whatever\nthe significance may be:\n\nMeerut, India, July, 1824 (_Living Age_, 52-186); Fifeshire, Scotland,\nsummer of 1824 (_Wernerian Nat. Hist. Soc. Trans._, 5-575); Moradabad,\nIndia, July, 1826 (_Living Age_, 52-186); Ross-shire, Scotland, 1828\n(_Living Age_, 52-186); Moradabad, India, about 1829 (_Lin. Soc.

Asiatic Soc. of Bengal_,\n2-650). A psycho-tropism that arises here--disregarding serial significance--or\nmechanical, unintelligent, repulsive reflex--is that the fishes of India\ndid not fall from the sky; that they were found upon the ground after\ntorrential rains, because streams had overflowed and had then receded. In the region of Inertness that we think we can conceive of, or a zone\nthat is to this earth's gravitation very much like the neutral zone of\na magnet's attraction, we accept that there are bodies of water and also\nclear spaces--bottoms of ponds dropping out--very interesting ponds,\nhaving no earth at bottom--vast drops of water afloat in what is called\nspace--fishes and deluges of water falling--\n\nBut also other areas, in which fishes--however they got there: a matter\nthat we'll consider--remain and dry, or even putrefy, then sometimes\nfalling by atmospheric dislodgment. After a \"tremendous deluge of rain, one of the heaviest falls on record\"\n(_All the Year Round_, 8-255) at Rajkote, India, about 1850, \"the\nground was found literally covered with fishes.\"\n\nThe word \"found\" is agreeable to the repulsions of the conventionalists\nand their concept of an overflowing stream--but, according to Dr. Buist,\nsome of these fishes were \"found\" on the tops of haystacks. Ferrel (_A Popular Treatise_, p. 414) tells of a fall of living\nfishes--some of them having been placed in a tank, where they\nsurvived--that occurred in India, about 20 miles south of Calcutta,\nSept. 20, 1839. A witness of this fall says:\n\n\"The most strange thing which ever struck me was that the fish did not\nfall helter-skelter, or here and there, but they fell in a straight\nline, not more than a cubit in breadth.\" See _Living Age_, 52-186. _Amer. Jour. Sci._, 1-32-199:\n\nThat, according to testimony taken before a magistrate, a fall occurred,\nFeb. 19, 1830, near Feridpoor, India, of many fishes, of various\nsizes--some whole and fresh and others \"mutilated and putrefying.\" Our\nreflex to those who would say that, in the climate of India, it would\nnot take long for fishes to putrefy, is--that high in the air, the\nclimate of India is not torrid. Another peculiarity of this fall is that\nsome of the fishes were much larger than others. Or to those who hold\nout for segregation in a whirlwind, or that objects, say, twice as heavy\nas others would be separated from the lighter, we point out that some of\nthese fishes were twice as heavy as others. In the _Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal_, 2-650, depositions of\nwitnesses are given:\n\n\"Some of the fish were fresh, but others were rotten and without heads.\"\n\n\"Among the number which I got, five were fresh and the rest stinking and\nheadless.\"\n\nThey remind us of His Grace's observation of some pages back. According to Dr. Buist, some of these fishes weighed one and a half\npounds each and others three pounds. A fall of fishes at Futtepoor, India, in the middle of the decade of the 1830s:\n\n\"They were all dead and dry.\" (Dr. Buist, _Living Age_, 52-186.)\n\nIndia is far away: about 1830 was long ago. _Nature_, Sept. 19, 1918-46:\n\nA correspondent writes, from the Dove Marine Laboratory, Cuttercoats,\nEngland, that, at Hindon, a suburb of Sunderland, Aug. 24, 1918,\nhundreds of small fishes, identified as sand eels, had fallen--\n\nAgain the small area: about 60 by 30 yards. The fall occurred during a heavy rain that was accompanied by\nthunder--or indications of disturbance aloft--but by no visible\nlightning. The sea is close to Hindon, but if you try to think of these\nfishes having described a trajectory in a whirlwind from the ocean,\nconsider this remarkable datum:\n\nThat, according to witnesses, the fall upon this small area occupied ten\nminutes. I cannot think of a clearer indication of a direct fall from a\nstationary source. And:\n\n\"The fish were all dead, and indeed stiff and hard, when picked up,\nimmediately after the occurrence.\"\n\nBy all of which I mean that we have only begun to pile up our data of\nthings that fall from a stationary source overhead: we'll have to take\nup the subject from many approaches before our acceptance, which seems\nquite as rigorously arrived at as ever has been a belief, can emerge\nfrom the accursed.",

I don't know how much the horse and the barn will help us to emerge:\nbut, if ever anything did go up from this earth's surface and stay\nup--those damned things may have:\n\n_Monthly Weather Review_, May, 1878:\n\nIn a tornado, in Wisconsin, late in the decade of the 1870s, \"a barn and a horse were\ncarried completely away, and neither horse nor barn, nor any portion of\neither have since been found.\"\n\nAfter that, which would be a little strong were it not for a steady\nimprovement in our digestions that I note as we go along, there is\nlittle of the bizarre or the unassimilable in the turtle that hovered\nsix months or so over a small town in Mississippi:\n\n_Monthly Weather Review_, May, 1894:\n\nThat, in the middle of the decade of the 1890s, at Vicksburg, Miss., fell a small piece of\nalabaster; that, at Bovina, eight miles from Vicksburg, fell a gopher\nturtle. They fell in a hailstorm. This item was widely copied at the time: for instance, _Nature_, one of\nthe volumes of 1894, page 430, and _Jour. Roy. Met. Soc._, 20-273. As to\ndiscussion--not a word. Or Science and its continuity with\nPresbyterianism--data like this are damned at birth. The _Weather\nReview_ does sprinkle, or baptize, or attempt to save, this infant--but\nin all the meteorological literature that I have gone through, after\nthat date--not a word, except mention once or twice. The Editor of the\n_Review_ says:\n\n\"An examination of the weather map shows that these hailstorms occur on\nthe south side of a region of cold northerly winds, and were but a small\npart of a series of similar storms; apparently some special local whirls\nor gusts carried heavy objects from this earth's surface up to the cloud\nregions.\"\n\nOf all incredibilities that we have to choose from, I give first place\nto a notion of a whirlwind pouncing upon a region and scrupulously\nselecting a turtle and a piece of alabaster. This time, the other\nmechanical thing \"there in the first place\" cannot rise in response to\nits stimulus: it is resisted in that these objects were coated with\nice--month of May in a southern state. If a whirlwind at all, there must\nhave been very limited selection: there is no record of the fall of\nother objects. But there is no attempt in the _Review_ to specify a\nwhirlwind. These strangely associated things were remarkably separated. They fell eight miles apart. Then--as if there were real reasoning--they must have been high to fall\nwith such divergence, or one of them must have been carried partly\nhorizontally eight miles farther than the other. But either supposition\nargues for power more than that of a local whirl or gust, or argues for\na great, specific disturbance, of which there is no record--for the\nmonth of May, 1894. Nevertheless--as if I really were reasonable--I do feel that I have to\naccept that this turtle had been raised from this earth's surface,\nsomewhere near Vicksburg--because the gopher turtle is common in the\nsouthern states. Then I think of a hurricane that occurred in the state of Mississippi\nweeks or months before in the middle of the decade of the 1890s. No--I don't look for it--and inevitably find it. Or that things can go up so high in hurricanes that they stay up\nindefinitely--but may, after a while, be shaken down by storms. Over and\nover have we noted the occurrence of strange falls in storms. So then\nthat the turtle and the piece of alabaster may have had far different\norigins--from different worlds, perhaps--have entered a region of\nsuspension over this earth--wafting near each other--long\nduration--final precipitation by atmospheric disturbance--with hail--or\nthat hailstones, too, when large, are phenomena of suspension of long\nduration: that it is highly unacceptable that the very large ones could\nbecome so great only in falling from the clouds. Over and over has the note of disagreeableness, or of putrefaction, been\nstruck--long duration. Other indications of long duration. I think of a region somewhere above this earth's surface in which\ngravitation is inoperative and is not governed by the square of the\ndistance--quite as magnetism is negligible at a very short distance from\na magnet. Theoretically the attraction of a magnet should decrease with\nthe square of the distance, but the falling-off is found to be almost\nabrupt at a short distance. I think that things raised from this earth's surface to that region have\nbeen held there until shaken down by storms--\n\nThe Super-Sargasso Sea.",

I think that things raised from this earth's surface to that region have\nbeen held there until shaken down by storms--\n\nThe Super-Sargasso Sea. Derelicts, rubbish, old cargoes from inter-planetary wrecks; things cast\nout into what is called space by convulsions of other planets, things\nfrom the times of the Alexanders, Caesars and Napoleons of Mars and\nJupiter and Neptune; things raised by this earth's cyclones: horses and\nbarns and elephants and flies and dodoes, moas, and pterodactyls; leaves\nfrom modern trees and leaves of the Carboniferous era--all, however,\ntending to disintegrate into homogeneous-looking muds or dusts, red or\nblack or yellow--treasure-troves for the palaeontologists and for the\narchaeologists--accumulations of centuries--cyclones of Egypt, Greece,\nand Assyria--fishes dried and hard, there a short time: others there\nlong enough to putrefy--\n\nBut the omnipresence of Heterogeneity--or living fishes, also--ponds of\nfresh water: oceans of salt water. As to the Law of Gravitation, I prefer to take one simple stand:\n\nOrthodoxy accepts the correlation and equivalence of forces:\n\nGravitation is one of these forces. All other forces have phenomena of repulsion and of inertness\nirrespective of distance, as well as of attraction. But Newtonian Gravitation admits attraction only:\n\nThen Newtonian Gravitation can be only one-third acceptable even to the\northodox, or there is denial of the correlation and equivalence of\nforces. Or still simpler:\n\nHere are the data. Make what you will, yourself, of them. In our Intermediatist revolt against homogeneous, or positive,\nexplanations, or our acceptance that the all-sufficing cannot be less\nthan universality, besides which, however, there would be nothing to\nsuffice, our expression upon the Super-Sargasso Sea, though it\nharmonizes with data of fishes that fall as if from a stationary\nsource--and, of course, with other data, too--is inadequate to account\nfor two peculiarities of the falls of frogs:\n\nThat never has a fall of tadpoles been reported;\n\nThat never has a fall of full-grown frogs been reported--\n\nAlways frogs a few months old. It sounds positive, but if there be such reports they are somewhere out\nof my range of reading. But tadpoles would be more likely to fall from the sky than would\nfrogs, little or big, if such falls be attributed to whirlwinds; and\nmore likely to fall from the Super-Sargasso Sea if, though very\ntentatively and provisionally, we accept the Super-Sargasso Sea. Before we take up an especial expression upon the fall of immature and\nlarval forms of life to this earth, and the necessity then of conceiving\nof some factor besides mere stationariness or suspension or stagnation,\nthere are other data that are similar to data of falls of fishes. _Science Gossip_, 1886-238:\n\nThat small snails, of a land species, had fallen near Redruth, Cornwall,\nin the middle of the decade of the 1880s, \"during a heavy thunderstorm\": roads and fields strewn\nwith them, so that they were gathered up by the hatful: none seen to\nfall by the writer of this account: snails said to be \"quite different\nto any previously known in this district.\"\n\nBut, upon page 282, we have better orthodoxy. Another correspondent\nwrites that he had heard of the supposed fall of snails: that he had\nsupposed that all such stories had gone the way of witch stories; that,\nto his astonishment, he had read an account of this absurd story in a\nlocal newspaper of \"great and deserved repute.\"\n\n\"I thought I should for once like to trace the origin of one of these\nfabulous tales.\"\n\nOur own acceptance is that justice cannot be in an intermediate\nexistence, in which there can be approximation only to justice or to\ninjustice; that to be fair is to have no opinion at all; that to be\nhonest is to be uninterested; that to investigate is to admit prejudice;\nthat nobody has ever really investigated anything, but has always sought\npositively to prove or to disprove something that was conceived of, or\nsuspected, in advance. \"As I suspected,\" says this correspondent, \"I found that the snails were\nof a familiar land-species\"--that they had been upon the ground \"in the\nfirst place.\"\n\nHe found that the snails had appeared after the rain: that \"astonished\nrustics had jumped to the conclusion that they had fallen.\"\n\nHe met one person who said that he had seen the snails fall. \"This was his error,\" says the investigator. In the _Philosophical Magazine_, 58-310, there is an account of snails\nsaid to have fallen at Bristol in a field of three acres, in such\nquantities that they were shoveled up. It is said that the snails \"may\nbe considered as a local species.\" Upon page 457, another correspondent\nsays that the numbers had been exaggerated, and that in his opinion they\nhad been upon the ground in the first place. But that there had been\nsome unusual condition aloft comes out in his observation upon \"the\ncurious azure-blue appearance of the sun, at the time.\"\n\n_Nature_, 47-278:\n\nThat, according to _Das Wetter_, December, 1892, upon Aug. 9, 1892, a\nyellow cloud appeared over Paderborn, Germany.",

From this cloud, fell a\ntorrential rain, in which were hundreds of mussels. There is no mention\nof whatever may have been upon the ground in the first place, nor of a\nwhirlwind. Lizards--said to have fallen on the sidewalks of Montreal, Canada, Dec. 28, 1857. (_Notes and Queries_, 8-6-104.)\n\nIn the _Scientific American_, 3-112, a correspondent writes, from South\nGranville, N.Y., that, during a heavy shower, about 1860, he heard a\npeculiar sound at his feet, and looking down, saw a snake lying as if\nstunned by a fall. It then came to life. Gray snake, about a foot long. These data have any meaning or lack of meaning or degree of damnation\nyou please: but, in the matter of the fall that occurred at Memphis,\nTennessee, occur some strong significances. Our quasi-reasoning upon\nthis subject applies to all segregations so far considered. _Monthly Weather Review_, Jan. 15, 1877:\n\nThat, in Memphis, Tenn., Jan. 15, 1877, rather strictly localized, or\n\"in a space of two blocks,\" and after a violent storm in which the rain\n\"fell in torrents,\" snakes were found. They were crawling on sidewalks,\nin yards, and in streets, and in masses--but \"none were found on roofs\nor any other elevation above ground\" and \"none were seen to fall.\"\n\nIf you prefer to believe that the snakes had always been there, or had\nbeen upon the ground in the first place, and that it was only that\nsomething occurred to call special attention to them, in the streets of\nMemphis, Jan. 15, 1877--why, that's sensible: that's the common sense\nthat has been against us from the first. It is not said whether the snakes were of a known species or not, but\nthat \"when first seen, they were of a dark brown, almost black.\"\nBlacksnakes, I suppose. If we accept that these snakes did fall, even though not seen to fall by\nall the persons who were out sight-seeing in a violent storm, and had\nnot been in the streets crawling loose or in thick tangled masses, in\nthe first place:\n\nIf we try to accept that these snakes had been raised from some other\npart of this earth's surface in a whirlwind:\n\nIf we try to accept that a whirlwind could segregate them--\n\nWe accept the segregation of other objects raised in that whirlwind. Then, near the place of origin, there would have been a fall of heavier\nobjects that had been snatched up with the snakes--stones, fence rails,\nlimbs of trees. Say that the snakes occupied the next gradation, and\nwould be the next to fall. Still farther would there have been separate\nfalls of lightest objects: leaves, twigs, tufts of grass. In the _Monthly Weather Review_ there is no mention of other falls said\nto have occurred anywhere in January, 1877. Again ours is the objection against such selectiveness by a whirlwind. Conceivably a whirlwind could scoop out a den of hibernating snakes,\nwith stones and earth and an infinitude of other d\u00e9bris, snatching up\ndozens of snakes--I don't know how many to a den--hundreds maybe--but,\naccording to the account of this occurrence in the _New York Times_,\nthere were thousands of them; alive; from one foot to eighteen inches in\nlength. The _Scientific American_, 36-86, records the fall, and says\nthat there were thousands of them. The usual whirlwind-explanation is\ngiven--\"but in what locality snakes exist in such abundance is yet a\nmystery.\"\n\nThis matter of enormousness of numbers suggests to me something of a\nmigratory nature--but that snakes in the United States do not migrate in\nthe month of January, if ever. As to falls or flutterings of winged insects from the sky, prevailing\nnotions of swarming would seem explanatory enough: nevertheless, in\ninstances of ants, there are some peculiar circumstances. _L'Astronomie_, 1889-353:\n\nFall of fishes, about 1889, in Holland; ants, Aug. 1, 1889,\nStrasbourg; little toads, Aug. 2, 1889, Savoy. Fall of ants, Cambridge, England, summer of 1874--\"some were wingless.\"\n(_Scientific American_, 30-193.) Enormous fall of ants, Nancy, France,\nlate in the decade of the 1880s--\"most of them were wingless.\" (_Nature_, 36-349.) Fall of\nenormous, unknown ants--size of wasps--Manitoba, June, 1895. (_Sci. Amer._, 72-385.)\n\nHowever, our expression will be:\n\nThat wingless, larval forms of life, in numbers so enormous that\nmigration from some place external to this earth is suggested, have\nfallen from the sky. That these \"migrations\"--if such can be our acceptance--have occurred at\na time of hibernation and burial far in the ground of larvae in the\nnorthern latitudes of this earth; that there is significance in\nrecurrence of these falls in the last of January--or that we have the\nsquare of an incredibility in such a notion as that of selection of\nlarvae by whirlwinds, compounded with selection of the last of January. I accept that there are \"snow worms\" upon this earth--whatever their\norigin may have been. In the _Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci.",

I accept that there are \"snow worms\" upon this earth--whatever their\norigin may have been. In the _Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. of Philadelphia_,\n1899-125, there is a description of yellow worms and black worms that\nhave been found together on glaciers in Alaska. Almost positively were\nthere no other forms of insect-life upon these glaciers, and there was\nno vegetation to support insect-life, except microscopic organisms. Nevertheless the description of this probably polymorphic species fits a\ndescription of larvae said to have fallen in Switzerland, and less\ndefinitely fits another description. There is no opposition here, if our\ndata of falls are clear. Frogs of every-day ponds look like frogs said\nto have fallen from the sky--except the whitish frogs of Birmingham. However, all falls of larvae have not positively occurred in the last of\nJanuary:\n\nLondon _Times_, late in the decade of the 1830s:\n\nThat, in the parish of Bramford Speke, Devonshire, a large number of\nblack worms, about three-quarters of an inch in length, had fallen in a\nsnowstorm. In Timb's _Year Book_, 1877-26, it is said that, in the winter of 1876,\nat Christiania, Norway, worms were found crawling upon the ground. The\noccurrence is considered a great mystery, because the worms could not\nhave come up from the ground, inasmuch as the ground was frozen at the\ntime, and because they were reported from other places, also, in Norway. Immense number of black insects in a snowstorm, in 1827, at Pakroff,\nRussia. (_Scientific American_, 30-193.)\n\nFall, with snow, at Orenburg, Russia, Dec. 14, 1830, of a multitude of\nsmall, black insects, said to have been gnats, but also said to have had\nflea-like motions. (_Amer. Jour. Sci._, 1-22-375.)\n\nLarge number of worms found in a snowstorm, upon the surface of snow\nabout four inches thick, near Sangerfield, N.Y., Nov. 18, 1850\n(_Scientific American_, 6-96). The writer thinks that the worms had been\nbrought to the surface of the ground by rain, which had fallen\npreviously. _Scientific American_, Feb. 21, 1891:\n\n\"A puzzling phenomenon has been noted frequently in some parts of the\nValley Bend District, Randolph County, Va., this winter. The crust of\nthe snow has been covered two or three times with worms resembling the\nordinary cut worms. Where they come from, unless they fall with the snow\nis inexplicable.\" In the _Scientific American_, about 1891, the\nEditor says that similar worms had been seen upon the snow near Utica,\nN.Y., and in Oneida and Herkimer Counties; that some of the worms had\nbeen sent to the Department of Agriculture at Washington. Again two\nspecies, or polymorphism. According to Prof. Riley, it was not\npolymorphism, \"but two distinct species\"--which, because of our data, we\ndoubt. One kind was larger than the other: color-differences not\ndistinctly stated. One is called the larvae of the common soldier beetle\nand the other \"seems to be a variety of the bronze cut worm.\" No attempt\nto explain the occurrence in snow. Fall of great numbers of larvae of beetles, near Mortagne, France, May,\n1858. The larvae were inanimate as if with cold. (_Annales Soci\u00e9t\u00e9\nEntomologique de France_, 1858.)\n\n_Trans. Ent. Soc. of London_, 1871-183, records \"snowing of larvae,\" in\nSilesia, 1806; \"appearance of many larvae on the snow,\" in Saxony,\n1811; \"larvae found alive on the snow,\" 1828; larvae and snow which\n\"fell together,\" in the Eifel, Jan. 30, 1847; \"fall of insects,\" Jan. 24, 1849, in Lithuania; occurrence of larvae estimated at 300,000 on the\nsnow in Switzerland, in 1856. The compiler says that most of these\nlarvae live underground, or at the roots of trees; that whirlwinds\nuproot trees, and carry away the larvae--conceiving of them as not held\nin masses of frozen earth--all as neatly detachable as currants in\nsomething. In the _Revue et Magasin de Zoologie_, 1849-72, there is an\naccount of the fall in Lithuania, Jan. 24, 1849--that black larvae had\nfallen in enormous numbers. Larvae thought to have been of beetles, but described as \"caterpillars,\"\nnot seen to fall, but found crawling on the snow, after a snowstorm, at\nWarsaw, Jan. 20, 1850. (_All the Year Round_, 8-253.)\n\nFlammarion (_The Atmosphere_, p. 414) tells of a fall of larvae that\noccurred Jan. 30, 1869, in a snowstorm, in Upper Savoy: \"They could not\nhave been hatched in the neighborhood, for, during the days preceding,\nthe temperature had been very low\"; said to have been of a species\ncommon in the south of France. In _La Science Pour Tous_, 14-183, it is\nsaid that with these larvae there were developed insects. _L'Astronomie_, 1890-313:\n\nThat, upon the last of January, 1890, there fell, in a great tempest, in\nSwitzerland, incalculable numbers of larvae: some black and some yellow;\nnumbers so great that hosts of birds were attracted. Altogether we regard this as one of our neatest expressions for external\norigins and against the whirlwind explanation.",

    "text": "In the _Revue et Magasin de Zoologie_, 1849-72, there is an\naccount of the fall in Lithuania, Jan. 24, 1849--that black larvae had\nfallen in enormous numbers. Larvae thought to have been of beetles, but described as \"caterpillars,\"\nnot seen to fall, but found crawling on the snow, after a snowstorm, at\nWarsaw, Jan. 20, 1850. (_All the Year Round_, 8-253.)\n\nFlammarion (_The Atmosphere_, p. 414) tells of a fall of larvae that\noccurred Jan. 30, 1869, in a snowstorm, in Upper Savoy: \"They could not\nhave been hatched in the neighborhood, for, during the days preceding,\nthe temperature had been very low\"; said to have been of a species\ncommon in the south of France. In _La Science Pour Tous_, 14-183, it is\nsaid that with these larvae there were developed insects. _L'Astronomie_, 1890-313:\n\nThat, upon the last of January, 1890, there fell, in a great tempest, in\nSwitzerland, incalculable numbers of larvae: some black and some yellow;\nnumbers so great that hosts of birds were attracted. Altogether we regard this as one of our neatest expressions for external\norigins and against the whirlwind explanation. If an exclusionist says\nthat, in January, larvae were precisely and painstakingly picked out of\nfrozen ground, in incalculable numbers, he thinks of a tremendous\nforce--disregarding its refinements: then if origin and precipitation be\nnot far apart, what becomes of an infinitude of other d\u00e9bris, conceiving\nof no time for segregation? If he thinks of a long translation--all the way from the south of France\nto Upper Savoy, he may think then of a very fine sorting over by\ndifferences of specific gravity--but in such a fine selection, larvae\nwould be separated from developed insects. As to differences in specific gravity--the yellow larvae that fell in\nSwitzerland January, 1890, were three times the size of the black larvae\nthat fell with them. In accounts of this occurrence, there is no denial\nof the fall. Or that a whirlwind never brought them together and held them together\nand precipitated them and only them together--\n\nThat they came from Genesistrine. There's no escape from it. We'll be persecuted for it. Take it or leave\nit--\n\nGenesistrine. The notion is that there is somewhere aloft a place of origin of life\nrelatively to this earth. Whether it's the planet Genesistrine, or the\nmoon, or a vast amorphous region super-jacent to this earth, or an\nisland in the Super-Sargasso Sea, should perhaps be left to the\nresearches of other super--or extra--geographers. That the first\nunicellular organisms may have come here from Genesistrine--or that men\nor anthropomorphic beings may have come here before amoebae: that, upon\nGenesistrine, there may have been an evolution expressible in\nconventional biologic terms, but that evolution upon this earth has\nbeen--like evolution in modern Japan--induced by external influences;\nthat evolution, as a whole, upon this earth, has been a process of\npopulation by immigration or by bombardment. Some notes I have upon\nremains of men and animals encysted, or covered with clay or stone, as\nif fired here as projectiles, I omit now, because it seems best to\nregard the whole phenomenon as a tropism--as a geotropism--probably\natavistic, or vestigial, as it were, or something still continuing long\nafter expiration of necessity; that, once upon a time, all kinds of\nthings came here from Genesistrine, but that now only a few kinds of\nbugs and things, at long intervals, feel the inspiration. Not one instance have we of tadpoles that have fallen to this earth. It\nseems reasonable that a whirlwind could scoop up a pond, frogs and all,\nand cast down the frogs somewhere else: but, then, more reasonable that\na whirlwind could scoop up a pond, tadpoles and all--because tadpoles\nare more numerous in their season than are the frogs in theirs: but the\ntadpole-season is earlier in the spring, or in a time that is more\ntempestuous. Thinking in terms of causation--as if there were real\ncauses--our notion is that, if X is likely to cause Y, but is more\nlikely to cause Z, but does not cause Z, X is not the cause of Y. Upon\nthis quasi-sorites, we base our acceptance that the little frogs that\nhave fallen to this earth are not products of whirlwinds: that they came\nfrom externality, or from Genesistrine. I think of Genesistrine in terms of biologic mechanics: not that\nsomewhere there are persons who collect bugs in or about the last of\nJanuary and frogs in July and August, and bombard this earth, any more\nthan do persons go through northern regions, catching and collecting\nbirds, every autumn, then casting them southward. But atavistic, or vestigial, geotropism in Genesistrine--or a million\nlarvae start crawling, and a million little frogs start hopping--knowing\nno more what it's all about than we do when we crawl to work in the\nmorning and hop away at night. I should say, myself, that Genesistrine is a region in the\nSuper-Sargasso Sea, and that parts of the Super-Sargasso Sea have\nrhythms of susceptibility to this earth's attraction. I accept that, when there are storms, the damnedest of excluded,\nexcommunicated things--things that are leprous to the faithful--are\nbrought down--from the Super-Sargasso Sea--or from what for convenience\nwe call the Super-Sargasso Sea--which by no means has been taken into\nfull acceptance yet. That things are brought down by storms, just as, from the depths of the\nsea things are brought up by storms. To be sure it is orthodoxy that\nstorms have little, if any, effect below the waves of the ocean--but--of\ncourse--only to have an opinion is to be ignorant of, or to disregard a\ncontradiction, or something else that modifies an opinion out of\ndistinguishability. _Symons' Meteorological Magazine_, 47-180:\n\nThat, along the coast of New Zealand, in regions not subject to\nsubmarine volcanic action, deep-sea fishes are often brought up by\nstorms.",

Iron and stones that fall from the sky; and atmospheric disturbances:\n\n\"There is absolutely no connection between the two phenomena.\"\n(_Symons._)\n\nThe orthodox belief is that objects moving at planetary velocity would,\nupon entering this earth's atmosphere, be virtually unaffected by\nhurricanes; might as well think of a bullet swerved by someone fanning\nhimself. The only trouble with the orthodox reasoning is the usual\ntrouble--its phantom-dominant--its basing upon a myth--data we've had,\nand more we'll have, of things in the sky having no independent\nvelocity. There are so many storms and so many meteors and meteorites that it\nwould be extraordinary if there were no concurrences. Nevertheless so\nmany of these concurrences are listed by Prof. Baden-Powell (_Rept. Brit. Assoc._, 1850-54) that one--notices. See _Rept. Brit. Assoc._, 1860--other instances. The famous fall of stones at Siena, Italy, 1794--\"in a violent storm.\"\n\nSee _Greg's Catalogues_--many instances. One that stands out is--\"bright\nball of fire and light in a hurricane in England, Sept. 2, 1786.\" The\nremarkable datum here is that this phenomenon was visible forty minutes. That's about 800 times the duration that the orthodox give to meteors\nand meteorites. See the _Annual Register_--many instances. In _Nature_, Oct. 25, 1877, and the London _Times_, Oct. 15, 1877,\nsomething that fell in a gale of Oct. 14, 1877, is described as a \"huge\nball of green fire.\" This phenomenon is described by another\ncorrespondent, in _Nature_, 17-10, and an account of it by another\ncorrespondent was forwarded to _Nature_ by W.F. Denning. There are so many instances that some of us will revolt against the\ninsistence of the faithful that it is only coincidence, and accept that\nthere is connection of the kind called causal. If it is too difficult to\nthink of stones and metallic masses swerved from their courses by\nstorms, if they move at high velocity, we think of low velocity, or of\nthings having no velocity at all, hovering a few miles above this earth,\ndislodged by storms, and falling luminously. But the resistance is so great here, and \"coincidence\" so insisted upon\nthat we'd better have some more instances:\n\nAerolite in a storm at St. Leonards-on-sea, England, Sept. 17, 1885--no\ntrace of it found (_Annual Register_, 1885); meteorite in a gale, in the middle of the decade of the 1880s, described in the _Monthly Weather Review_, March, 1886;\nmeteorite in a thunderstorm, off coast of Greece, Nov. 19, 1899\n(_Nature_, 61-111); fall of a meteorite in a storm, in the middle of the decade of the 1880s, near\nLachine, Quebec (_Monthly Weather Review_, July, 1883); same phenomenon\nnoted in _Nature_, 28-319; meteorite in a whirlwind, Sweden, Sept. 24,\n1883 (_Nature_, 29-15). _London Roy. Soc. Proc._, 6-276:\n\nA triangular cloud that appeared in a storm, Dec. 17, 1852; a red\nnucleus, about half the apparent diameter of the moon, and a long tail;\nvisible 13 minutes; explosion of the nucleus. Nevertheless, in _Science Gossip_, n.s., 6-65, it is said that, though\nmeteorites have fallen in storms, no connection is supposed to exist\nbetween the two phenomena, except by the ignorant peasantry. But some of us peasants have gone through the _Report of the British\nAssociation_, 1852. Upon page 239, Dr. Buist, who had never heard of the\nSuper-Sargasso Sea, says that, though it is difficult to trace\nconnection between the phenomena, three aerolites had fallen in five\nmonths, in India, during thunderstorms, in 1851 (may have been 1852). For accounts by witnesses, see page 229 of the _Report_. Or--we are on our way to account for \"thunderstones.\"\n\nIt seems to me that, very strikingly here, is borne out the general\nacceptance that ours is only an intermediate existence, in which there\nis nothing fundamental, or nothing final to take as a positive standard\nto judge by. Peasants believed in meteorites. Scientists excluded meteorites. Peasants believe in \"thunderstones.\"\n\nScientists exclude \"thunderstones.\"\n\nIt is useless to argue that peasants are out in the fields, and that\nscientists are shut up in laboratories and lecture rooms. We cannot take\nfor a real base that, as to phenomena with which they are more\nfamiliar, peasants are more likely to be right than are scientists: a\nhost of biologic and meteorologic fallacies of peasants rises against\nus. I should say that our \"existence\" is like a bridge--except that that\ncomparison is in static terms--but like the Brooklyn Bridge, upon which\nmultitudes of bugs are seeking a fundamental--coming to a girder that\nseems firm and final--but the girder is built upon supports. A support\nthen seems final. But it is built upon underlying structures. Nothing\nfinal can be found in all the bridge, because the bridge itself is not a\nfinal thing in itself, but is a relationship between Manhattan and\nBrooklyn. If our \"existence\" is a relationship between the Positive\nAbsolute and the Negative Absolute, the quest for finality in it is\nhopeless: everything in it must be relative, if the \"whole\" is not a\nwhole, but is, itself, a relation.",

In the attitude of Acceptance, our pseudo-base is:\n\nCells of an embryo are in the reptilian era of the embryo;\n\nSome cells feel stimuli to take on new appearances. If it be of the design of the whole that the next era be mammalian,\nthose cells that turn mammalian will be sustained against resistance, by\ninertia, of all the rest, and will be relatively right, though not\nfinally right, because they, too, in time will have to give way to\ncharacters of other eras of higher development. If we are upon the verge of a new era, in which Exclusionism must be\noverthrown, it will avail thee not to call us base-born and frowsy\npeasants. In our crude, bucolic way, we now offer an outrage upon common sense\nthat we think will some day be an unquestioned commonplace:\n\nThat manufactured objects of stone and iron have fallen from the sky:\n\nThat they have been brought down from a state of suspension, in a region\nof inertness to this earth's attraction, by atmospheric disturbances. The \"thunderstone\" is usually \"a beautifully polished, wedge-shaped\npiece of greenstone,\" says a writer in the _Cornhill Magazine_, 50-517. It isn't: it's likely to be of almost any kind of stone, but we call\nattention to the skill with which some of them have been made. Of\ncourse this writer says it's all superstition. Otherwise he'd be one of\nus crude and simple sons of the soil. Conventional damnation is that stone implements, already on the\nground--\"on the ground in the first place\"--are found near where\nlightning was seen to strike: that are supposed by astonished rustics,\nor by intelligence of a low order, to have fallen in or with lightning. Throughout this book, we class a great deal of science with bad fiction. When is fiction bad, cheap, low? If coincidence is overworked. That's\none way of deciding. But with single writers coincidence seldom is\noverworked: we find the excess in the subject at large. Such a writer as\nthe one of the _Cornhill Magazine_ tells us vaguely of beliefs of\npeasants: there is no massing of instance after instance after instance. Here ours will be the method of mass-formation. Conceivably lightning may strike the ground near where there was a\nwedge-shaped object in the first place: again and again and again:\nlightning striking ground near wedge-shaped object in China; lightning\nstriking ground near wedge-shaped object in Scotland; lightning striking\nground near wedge-shaped object in Central Africa: coincidence in\nFrance; coincidence in Java; coincidence in South America--\n\nWe grant a great deal but note a tendency to restlessness. Nevertheless\nthis is the psycho-tropism of science to all \"thunderstones\" said to\nhave fallen luminously. As to greenstone, it is in the island of Jamaica, where the notion is\ngeneral that axes of a hard greenstone fall from the sky--\"during the\nrains.\" (_Jour. Inst. Jamaica_, 2-4.) Some other time we shall inquire\ninto this localization of objects of a specific material. \"They are of a\nstone nowhere else to be found in Jamaica.\" (_Notes and Queries_,\n2-8-24.)\n\nIn my own tendency to exclude, or in the attitude of one peasant or\nsavage who thinks he is not to be classed with other peasants or\nsavages, I am not very much impressed with what natives think. It would\nbe hard to tell why. If the word of a Lord Kelvin carries no more\nweight, upon scientific subjects, than the word of a Sitting Bull,\nunless it be in agreement with conventional opinion--I think it must be\nbecause savages have bad table manners. However, my snobbishness, in\nthis respect, loosens up somewhat before very widespread belief by\nsavages and peasants. And the notion of \"thunderstones\" is as wide as\ngeography itself. The natives of Burma, China, Japan, according to Blinkenberg (_Thunder\nWeapons_, p. 100)--not, of course, that Blinkenberg accepts one word of\nit--think that carved stone objects have fallen from the sky, because\nthey think they have seen such objects fall from the sky. Such objects\nare called \"thunderbolts\" in these countries. They are called\n\"thunderstones\" in Moravia, Holland, Belgium, France, Cambodia, Sumatra,\nand Siberia. They're called \"storm stones\" in Lausitz; \"sky arrows\" in\nSlavonia; \"thunder axes\" in England and Scotland; \"lightning stones\" in\nSpain and Portugal; \"sky axes\" in Greece; \"lightning flashes\" in Brazil;\n\"thunder teeth\" in Amboina. The belief is as widespread as is belief in ghosts and witches, which\nonly the superstitious deny today. As to beliefs by North American Indians, Tyler gives a list of\nreferences (_Primitive Culture_, 2-237). As to South American\nIndians--\"Certain stone hatchets are said to have fallen from the\nheavens.\" (_Jour. Amer.",

Folk Lore_, 17-203.)\n\nIf you, too, revolt against coincidence after coincidence after\ncoincidence, but find our interpretation of \"thunderstones\" just a\nlittle too strong or rich for digestion, we recommend the explanation of\none, Tallius, written in 1649:\n\n\"The naturalists say they are generated in the sky by fulgurous\nexhalation conglobed in a cloud by the circumfused humor.\"\n\nOf course the paper in the _Cornhill Magazine_ was written with no\nintention of trying really to investigate this subject, but to deride\nthe notion that worked-stone objects have ever fallen from the sky. A\nwriter in the _Amer. Jour. Sci._, 1-21-325, read this paper and thinks\nit remarkable \"that any man of ordinary reasoning powers should write a\npaper to prove that thunderbolts do not exist.\"\n\nI confess that we're a little flattered by that. Over and over:\n\n\"It is scarcely necessary to suggest to the intelligent reader that\nthunderstones are a myth.\"\n\nWe contend that there is a misuse of a word here: we admit that only we\nare intelligent upon this subject, if by intelligence is meant the\ninquiry of inequilibrium, and that all other intellection is only\nmechanical reflex--of course that intelligence, too, is mechanical, but\nless orderly and confined: less obviously mechanical--that as an\nacceptance of ours becomes firmer and firmer-established, we pass from\nthe state of intelligence to reflexes in ruts. An odd thing is that\nintelligence is usually supposed to be creditable. It may be in the\nsense that it is mental activity trying to find out, but it is\nconfession of ignorance. The bees, the theologians, the dogmatic\nscientists are the intellectual aristocrats. The rest of us are\nplebeians, not yet graduated to Nirvana, or to the instinctive and suave\nas differentiated from the intelligent and crude. Blinkenberg gives many instances of the superstition of \"thunderstones\"\nwhich flourishes only where mentality is in a lamentable state--or\nuniversally. In Malacca, Sumatra, and Java, natives say that stone axes\nhave often been found under trees that have been struck by lightning. Blinkenberg does not dispute this, but says it is coincidence: that the\naxes were of course upon the ground in the first place: that the natives\njumped to the conclusion that these carved stones had fallen in or with\nlightning. In Central Africa, it is said that often have wedge-shaped,\nhighly polished objects of stone, described as \"axes,\" been found\nsticking in trees that have been struck by lightning--or by what seemed\nto be lightning. The natives, rather like the unscientific persons of\nMemphis, Tenn., when they saw snakes after a storm, jumped to the\nconclusion that the \"axes\" had not always been sticking in the trees. Livingstone (_Last Journal_, pages 83, 89, 442, 448) says that he had\nnever heard of stone implements used by natives of Africa. A writer in\nthe _Report of the Smithsonian Institution_, 1877-308, says that there\nare a few. That they are said, by the natives, to have fallen in thunderstorms. As to luminosity, it is my lamentable acceptance that bodies falling\nthrough this earth's atmosphere, if not warmed even, often fall with a\nbrilliant light, looking like flashes of lightning. This matter seems\nimportant: we'll take it up later, with data. In Prussia, two stone\naxes were found in the trunks of trees, one under the bark. (Blinkenberg, _Thunder Weapons_, p. 100.)\n\nThe finders jumped to the conclusion that the axes had fallen there. Another stone ax--or wedge-shaped object of worked stone--said to have\nbeen found in a tree that had been struck by something that looked like\nlightning. (_Thunder Weapons_, p. 71.)\n\nThe finder jumped to the conclusion. Story told by Blinkenberg, of a woman, who lived near Kulsbjaergene,\nSweden, who found a flint near an old willow--\"near her house.\" I\nemphasize \"near her house\" because that means familiar ground. The\nwillow had been split by something. She jumped. Cow killed by lightning, or by what looked like lightning (Isle of Sark,\nnear Guernsey). The peasant who owned the cow dug up the ground at the\nspot and found a small greenstone \"ax.\" Blinkenberg says that he jumped\nto the conclusion that it was this object that had fallen luminously,\nkilling the cow. _Reliquary_, 1867-208:\n\nA flint ax found by a farmer, after a severe storm--described as a\n\"fearful storm\"--by a signal staff, which had been split by something. I\nshould say that nearness to a signal staff may be considered familiar\nground. Whether he jumped, or arrived at the conclusion by a more leisurely\nprocess, the farmer thought that the flint object had fallen in the\nstorm. In this instance we have a lamentable scientist with us. It's impossible\nto have positive difference between orthodoxy and heresy: somewhere\nthere must be a merging into each other, or an overlapping. Nevertheless, upon such a subject as this, it does seem a little\nshocking.",

It's impossible\nto have positive difference between orthodoxy and heresy: somewhere\nthere must be a merging into each other, or an overlapping. Nevertheless, upon such a subject as this, it does seem a little\nshocking. In most works upon meteorites, the peculiar, sulphurous odor\nof things that fall from the sky is mentioned. Sir John Evans (_Stone\nImplements_, p. 57) says--with extraordinary reasoning powers, if he\ncould never have thought such a thing with ordinary reasoning\npowers--that this flint object \"proved to have been the bolt, by its\npeculiar smell when broken.\"\n\nIf it did so prove to be, that settles the whole subject. If we prove\nthat only one object of worked stone has fallen from the sky, all piling\nup of further reports is unnecessary. However, we have already taken the\nstand that nothing settles anything; that the disputes of ancient Greece\nare no nearer solution now than they were several thousand years\nago--all because, in a positive sense, there is nothing to prove or\nsolve or settle. Our object is to be more nearly real than our\nopponents. Wideness is an aspect of the Universal. We go on widely. According to us the fat man is nearer godliness than is the thin man. Eat, drink, and approximate to the Positive Absolute. Beware of\nnegativeness, by which we mean indigestion. The vast majority of \"thunderstones\" are described as \"axes,\" but\nMeunier (_La Nature_, 1892-2-381) tells of one that was in his\npossession; said to have fallen at Ghardia, Algeria, contrasting\n\"profoundment\" (pear-shaped) with the angular outlines of ordinary\nmeteorites. The conventional explanation that it had been formed as a\ndrop of molten matter from a larger body seems reasonable to me; but\nwith less agreeableness I note its fall in a thunderstorm, the datum\nthat turns the orthodox meteorologist pale with rage, or induces a\nslight elevation of his eyebrows, if you mention it to him. Meunier tells of another \"thunderstone\" said to have fallen in North\nAfrica. Meunier, too, is a little lamentable here: he quotes a soldier\nof experience that such objects fall most frequently in the deserts of\nAfrica. Rather miscellaneous now:\n\n\"Thunderstone\" said to have fallen in London, April, 1876: weight about\n8 pounds: no particulars as to shape (Timb's _Year Book_, 1877-246). \"Thunderstone\" said to have fallen at Cardiff, Sept. 26, 1916 (London\n_Times_, Sept. 28, 1916). According to _Nature_, 98-95, it was\ncoincidence; only a lightning flash had been seen. Stone that fell in a storm, near St. Albans, England: accepted by the\nMuseum of St. Albans; said, at the British Museum, not to be of \"true\nmeteoritic material.\" (_Nature_, 80-34.)\n\nLondon _Times_, in the middle of the decade of the 1870s:\n\nThat, about 1876, near Wolverhampton, fell a mass of meteoritic iron\nduring a heavy fall of rain. An account of this phenomenon in _Nature_,\n14-272, by H.S. Maskelyne, who accepts it as authentic. Also, see\n_Nature_, 13-531. For three other instances, see the _Scientific American_, 47-194; 52-83;\n68-325. As to wedge-shape larger than could very well be called an \"ax\":\n\n_Nature_, 30-300:\n\nThat, about 1884, at Tysnas, Norway, a meteorite had fallen: that the\nturf was torn up at the spot where the object had been supposed to have\nfallen; that two days later \"a very peculiar stone\" was found near by. The description is--\"in shape and size very like the fourth part of a\nlarge Stilton cheese.\"\n\nIt is our acceptance that many objects and different substances have\nbeen brought down by atmospheric disturbance from what--only as a matter\nof convenience now, and until we have more data--we call the\nSuper-Sargasso Sea; however, our chief interest is in objects that have\nbeen shaped by means similar to human handicraft. Description of the \"thunderstones\" of Burma (_Proc. Asiatic Soc. of\nBengal_, 1869-183): said to be of a kind of stone unlike any other found\nin Burma; called \"thunderbolts\" by the natives.

Just as a great deal of Voltaire's meaning was\ninter-linear, we suspect that a Captain Duff merely hints rather than\nto risk having a Prof. Lawrence Smith fly at him and call him \"a\nhalf-insane man.\" Whatever Captain Duff's meaning may have been, and\nwhether he smiled like a Voltaire when he wrote it, Captain Duff writes\nof \"the extremely soft nature of the stone, rendering it equally useless\nas an offensive or defensive weapon.\"\n\nStory, by a correspondent, in _Nature_, 34-53, of a Malay, of\n\"considerable social standing\"--and one thing about our data is that,\ndamned though they be, they do so often bring us into awful good\ncompany--who knew of a tree that had been struck, about a month before,\nby something in a thunderstorm. He searched among the roots of this tree\nand found a \"thunderstone.\" Not said whether he jumped or leaped to the\nconclusion that it had fallen: process likely to be more leisurely in\ntropical countries. Also I'm afraid his way of reasoning was not very\noriginal: just so were fragments of the Bath-furnace meteorite, accepted\nby orthodoxy, discovered. We shall now have an unusual experience. We shall read of some reports\nof extraordinary circumstances that were investigated by a man of\nscience--not of course that they were really investigated by him, but\nthat his phenomena occupied a position approximating higher to real\ninvestigation than to utter neglect. Over and over we read of\nextraordinary occurrences--no discussion; not even a comment afterward\nfindable; mere mention occasionally--burial and damnation. The extraordinary and how quickly it is hidden away. Burial and damnation, or the obscurity of the conspicuous. We did read of a man who, in the matter of snails, did travel some\ndistance to assure himself of something that he had suspected in\nadvance; and we remember Prof. Hitchcock, who had only to smite Amherst\nwith the wand of his botanical knowledge, and lo! two fungi sprang up\nbefore night; and we did read of Dr. Gray and his thousands of fishes\nfrom one pailful of water--but these instances stand out; more\nfrequently there was no \"investigation.\" We now have a good many\nreported occurrences that were \"investigated.\" Of things said to have\nfallen from the sky, we make, in the usual scientific way, two\ndivisions: miscellaneous objects and substances, and symmetric objects\nattributable to beings like human beings, sub-dividing into--wedges,\nspheres, and disks. _Jour. Roy. Met. Soc._, 14-207:\n\nThat, about 1866, a correspondent to a London newspaper wrote that\nsomething had fallen from the sky, during a thunderstorm of about 1866, at Netting Hill. Mr. G.T. Symons, of _Symons' Meteorological\nMagazine_, investigated, about as fairly, and with about as unprejudiced\na mind, as anything ever has been investigated. He says that the object was nothing but a lump of coal: that next door\nto the home of the correspondent coal had been unloaded the day before. With the uncanny wisdom of the stranger upon unfamiliar ground that we\nhave noted before, Mr. Symons saw that the coal reported to have fallen\nfrom the sky, and the coal unloaded more prosaically the day before,\nwere identical. Persons in the neighborhood, unable to make this simple\nidentification, had bought from the correspondent pieces of the object\nreported to have fallen from the sky. As to credulity, I know of no\nlimits for it--but when it comes to paying out money for credulity--oh,\nno standards to judge by, of course--just the same--\n\nThe trouble with efficiency is that it will merge away into excess. With\nwhat seems to me to be super-abundance of convincingness, Mr. Symons\nthen lugs another character into his little comedy:\n\nThat it was all a hoax by a chemist's pupil, who had filled a capsule\nwith an explosive, and \"during the storm had thrown the burning mass\ninto the gutter, so making an artificial thunderbolt.\"\n\nOr even Shakespeare, with all his inartistry, did not lug in King Lear\nto make Hamlet complete. Whether I'm lugging in something that has no special meaning, myself, or\nnot, I find that this storm of about 1866, was peculiar. It is\ndescribed in the London _Times_, about 1866: that \"during the storm,\nthe sky in many places remained partially clear while hail and rain were\nfalling.\" That may have more meaning when we take up the possible\nextra-mundane origin of some hailstones, especially if they fall from a\ncloudless sky. Mere suggestion, not worth much, that there may have been\nfalls of extra-mundane substances, in London, about 1866. Clinkers, said to have fallen, during a storm, at Kilburn, about 1877:\n\nAccording to the _Kilburn Times_, about 1877, quoted by Mr.",

Mere suggestion, not worth much, that there may have been\nfalls of extra-mundane substances, in London, about 1866. Clinkers, said to have fallen, during a storm, at Kilburn, about 1877:\n\nAccording to the _Kilburn Times_, about 1877, quoted by Mr. Symons, a\nstreet had been \"literally strewn,\" during the storm, with a mass of\nclinkers, estimated at about two bushels: sizes from that of a walnut to\nthat of a man's hand--\"pieces of the clinkers can be seen at the\n_Kilburn Times_ office.\"\n\nIf these clinkers, or cinders, were refuse from one of the\nsuper-mercantile constructions from which coke and coal and ashes\noccasionally fall to this earth, or, rather, to the Super-Sargasso Sea,\nfrom which dislodgment by tempests occurs, it is intermediatistic to\naccept that they must merge away somewhere with local phenomena of the\nscene of precipitation. If a red-hot stove should drop from a cloud into\nBroadway, someone would find that at about the time of the occurrence, a\nmoving van had passed, and that the moving men had tired of the stove,\nor something--that it had not been really red-hot, but had been rouged\ninstead of blacked, by some absent-minded housekeeper. Compared with\nsome of the scientific explanations that we have encountered, there's\nconsiderable restraint, I think, in that one. Mr. Symons learned that in the same street--he emphasizes that it was a\nshort street--there was a fire-engine station. I had such an impression\nof him hustling and bustling around at Notting Hill, searching cellars\nuntil he found one with newly arrived coal in it; ringing door bells,\nexciting a whole neighborhood, calling up to second-story windows,\nstopping people in the streets, hotter and hotter on the trail of a\nwretched imposter of a chemist's pupil. After his efficiency at Notting\nHill, we'd expect to hear that he went to the station, and--something\nlike this:\n\n\"It is said that clinkers fell, in your street, at about ten minutes\npast four o'clock, afternoon of July fifth. Will you look over your\nrecords and tell me where your engine was at about ten minutes past\nfour, July fifth?\"\n\nMr. Symons says:\n\n\"I think that most probably they had been raked out of the steam\nfire-engine.\"\n\nabout 1880, it was reported that a \"thunderstone\" had struck the\nhouse at 180 Oakley Street, Chelsea, falling down the chimney, into the\nkitchen grate. Mr. Symons investigated. He describes the \"thunderstone\" as an \"agglomeration of brick, soot,\nunburned coal, and cinder.\"\n\nHe says that, in his opinion, lightning had flashed down the chimney,\nand had fused some of the brick of it. He does think it remarkable that the lightning did not then scatter the\ncontents of the grate, which were disturbed only as if a heavy body had\nfallen. If we admit that climbing up the chimney to find out is too\nrigorous a requirement for a man who may have been large, dignified and\nsubject to expansions, the only unreasonableness we find in what he\nsays--as judged by our more modern outlook, is:\n\n\"I suppose that no one would suggest that bricks are manufactured in the\natmosphere.\"\n\nSounds a little unreasonable to us, because it is so of the positivistic\nspirit of former times, when it was not so obvious that the highest\nincredibility and laughability must merge away with the \"proper\"--as the\n_Sci. Am. Sup._ would say. The preposterous is always interpretable in\nterms of the \"proper,\" with which it must be continuous--or--clay-like\nmasses such as have fallen from the sky--tremendous heat generated by\ntheir velocity--they bake--bricks. We begin to suspect that Mr. Symons exhausted himself at Notting Hill. It's a warning to efficiency-fanatics. Then the instance of three lumps of earthy matter, found upon a\nwell-frequented path, after a thunderstorm, at Reading, about 1883. There are so many records of the fall of earthy matter from the sky that\nit would seem almost uncanny to find resistance here, were we not so\naccustomed to the uncompromising stands of orthodoxy--which, in our\nmetaphysics, represent good, as attempts, but evil in their\ninsufficiency. If I thought it necessary, I'd list one hundred and fifty\ninstances of earthy matter said to have fallen from the sky. It is his\nantagonism to atmospheric disturbance associated with the fall of things\nfrom the sky that blinds and hypnotizes a Mr. Symons here. This especial\nMr. Symons rejects the Reading substance because it was not \"of true\nmeteoritic material.\" It's uncanny--or it's not uncanny at all, but\nuniversal--if you don't take something for a standard of opinion, you\ncan't have any opinion at all: but, if you do take a standard, in some\nof its applications it must be preposterous. The carbonaceous\nmeteorites, which are unquestioned--though avoided, as we have seen--by\northodoxy, are more glaringly of untrue meteoritic material than was\nthis substance of Reading. Mr. Symons says that these three lumps were\nupon the ground \"in the first place.\"\n\nWhether these data are worth preserving or not, I think that the appeal\nthat this especial Mr. Symons makes is worthy of a place in the museum\nwe're writing.",

Mr. Symons says that these three lumps were\nupon the ground \"in the first place.\"\n\nWhether these data are worth preserving or not, I think that the appeal\nthat this especial Mr. Symons makes is worthy of a place in the museum\nwe're writing. He argues against belief in all external origins \"for our\ncredit as Englishmen.\" He is a patriot, but I think that these\nforeigners had a small chance \"in the first place\" for hospitality from\nhim. Then comes a \"small lump of iron (two inches in diameter)\" said to have\nfallen, during a thunderstorm, at Brixton, Aug. 17, 1887. Mr. Symons\nsays: \"At present I cannot trace it.\"\n\nHe was at his best at Notting Hill: there's been a marked falling off in\nhis later manner:\n\nIn the London _Times_, Feb. 1, 1888, it is said that a roundish object\nof iron had been found, \"after a violent thunderstorm,\" in a garden at\nBrixton, Aug. 17, 1887. It was analyzed by a chemist, who could not\nidentify it as true meteoritic material. Whether a product of\nworkmanship like human workmanship or not, this object is described as\nan oblate spheroid, about two inches across its major diameter. The\nchemist's name and address are given: Mr. J. James Morgan: Ebbw Vale. Garden--familiar ground--I suppose that in Mr. Symons' opinion this\nsymmetric object had been upon the ground \"in the first place,\" though\nhe neglects to say this. But we do note that he described this object as\na \"lump,\" which does not suggest the spheroidal or symmetric. It is our\nnotion that the word \"lump\" was, because of its meaning of\namorphousness, used purposely to have the next datum stand alone,\nremote, without similars. If Mr. Symons had said that there had been a\nreport of another round object that had fallen from the sky, his readers\nwould be attracted by an agreement. He distracts his readers by\ndescribing in terms of the unprecedented--\n\n\"Iron cannon ball.\"\n\nIt was found in a manure heap, in Sussex, after a thunderstorm. However, Mr. Symons argues pretty reasonably, it seems to me, that,\ngiven a cannon ball in a manure heap, in the first place, lightning\nmight be attracted by it, and, if seen to strike there, the untutored\nmind, or mentality below the average, would leap or jump, or proceed\nwith less celerity, to the conclusion that the iron object had fallen. Except that--if every farmer isn't upon very familiar ground--or if\nevery farmer doesn't know his own manure heap as well as Mr. Symons knew\nhis writing desk--\n\nThen comes the instance of a man, his wife, and his three daughters, at\nCasterton, Westmoreland, who were looking out at their lawn, during a\nthunderstorm, when they \"considered,\" as Mr. Symons expresses it, that\nthey saw a stone fall from the sky, kill a sheep, and bury itself in the\nground. They dug. They found a stone ball. Symons:\n\nCoincidence. It had been there in the first place. This object was exhibited at a meeting of the Royal Meteorological\nSociety by Mr. C. Carus-Wilson. It is described in the _Journal's_ list\nof exhibits as a \"sandstone\" ball. It is described as \"sandstone\" by Mr. Symons. Now a round piece of sandstone may be almost anywhere in the ground--in\nthe first place--but, by our more or less discreditable habit of prying\nand snooping, we find that this object was rather more complex and of\nmaterial less commonplace. In snooping through _Knowledge_, Oct. 9,\n1885, we read that this \"thunderstone\" was in the possession of Mr. C. Carus-Wilson, who tells the story of the witness and his family--the\nsheep killed, the burial of something in the earth, the digging, and the\nfinding. Mr. C. Carus-Wilson describes the object as a ball of hard,\nferruginous quartzite, about the size of a cocoanut, weight about twelve\npounds. Whether we're feeling around for significance or not, there is a\nsuggestion not only of symmetry but of structure in this object: it had\nan external shell, separated from a loose nucleus. Mr. Carus-Wilson\nattributes this cleavage to unequal cooling of the mass. My own notion is that there is very little deliberate misrepresentation\nin the writings of scientific men: that they are quite as guiltless in\nintent as are other hypnotic subjects. Such a victim of induced belief\nreads of a stone ball said to have fallen from the sky. Mechanically in\nhis mind arise impressions of globular lumps, or nodules, of sandstone,\nwhich are common almost everywhere. He assimilates the reported fall\nwith his impressions of objects in the ground, in the first place. To an\nintermediatist, the phenomena of intellection are only phenomena of\nuniversal process localized in human minds. The process called\n\"explanation\" is only a local aspect of universal assimilation. It looks\nlike materialism: but the intermediatist holds that interpretation of\nthe immaterial, as it is called, in terms of the material, as it is\ncalled, is no more rational than interpretation of the \"material\" in\nterms of the \"immaterial\": that there is in quasi-existence neither the\nmaterial nor the immaterial, but approximations one way or the other. But so hypnotic quasi-reasons: that globular lumps of sandstone are\ncommon.",

Whether he jumps or leaps, or whether only the frowsy and\nbase-born are so athletic, his is the impression, by assimilation, that\nthis especial object is a ball of sandstone. Or human mentality: its\ninhabitants are conveniences. It may be that Mr. Symons' paper was\nwritten before this object was exhibited to the members of the Society,\nand with the charity with which, for the sake of diversity, we\nintersperse our malices, we are willing to accept that he \"investigated\"\nsomething that he had never seen. But whoever listed this object was\nuncareful: it is listed as \"sandstone.\"\n\nWe're making excuses for them. Really--as it were--you know, we're not quite so damned as we were. One does not apologize for the gods and at the same time feel quite\nutterly prostrate before them. If this were a real existence, and all of us real persons, with real\nstandards to judge by, I'm afraid we'd have to be a little severe with\nsome of these Mr. Symonses. As it is, of course, seriousness seems out\nof place. We note an amusing little touch in the indefinite allusion to \"a man,\"\nwho with his un-named family, had \"considered\" that he had seen a stone\nfall. The \"man\" was the Rev. W. Carus-Wilson, who was well-known in his\nday. The next instance was reported by W.B. Tripp, F.R.M.S.--that, during a\nthunderstorm, a farmer had seen the ground in front of him plowed up by\nsomething that was luminous. Dug. Bronze ax. My own notion is that an expedition to the North Pole could not be so\nurgent as that representative scientists should have gone to that farmer\nand there spent a summer studying this one reported occurrence. As it\nis--un-named farmer--somewhere--no date. The thing must stay damned. Another specimen for our museum is a comment in _Nature_ upon these\nobjects: that they are \"of an amusing character, thus clearly showing\nthat they were of terrestrial, and not a celestial, character.\" Just why\ncelestiality, or that of it which, too, is only of Intermediateness\nshould not be quite as amusing as terrestriality is beyond our reasoning\npowers, which we have agreed are not ordinary. Of course there is\nnothing amusing about wedges and spheres at all--or Archimedes and\nEuclid are humorists. It is that they were described derisively. If\nyou'd like a little specimen of the standardization of orthodox\nopinion--\n\n_Amer. Met. Jour._, 4-589:\n\n\"They are of an amusing character, thus clearly showing that they were\nof a terrestrial and not a celestial character.\"\n\nI'm sure--not positively, of course--that we've tried to be as easygoing\nand lenient with Mr. Symons as his obviously scientific performance\nwould permit. Of course it may be that sub-consciously we were\nprejudiced against him, instinctively classing him with St. Augustine,\nDarwin, St. Jerome, and Lyell. As to the \"thunderstones,\" I think that\nhe investigated them mostly \"for the credit of Englishmen,\" or in the\nspirit of the Royal Krakatoa Committee, or about as the commission from\nthe French Academy investigated meteorites. According to a writer in\n_Knowledge_, 5-418, the Krakatoa Committee attempted not in the least to\nprove what had caused the atmospheric effects of 1883, but to\nprove--that Krakatoa did it. Altogether I should think that the following quotation should be\nenlightening to anyone who still thinks that these occurrences were\ninvestigated not to support an opinion formed in advance:\n\nIn opening his paper, Mr. Symons says that he undertook his\ninvestigation as to the existence of \"thunderstones,\" or \"thunderbolts\"\nas he calls them--\"feeling certain that there was a weak point\nsomewhere, inasmuch as 'thunderbolts' have no existence.\"\n\nWe have another instance of the reported fall of a \"cannon ball.\" It\noccurred prior to Mr. Symons' investigations, but is not mentioned by\nhim. It was investigated, however. In the _Proc. Roy. Soc. Edin._,\n3-147, is the report of a \"thunderstone,\" \"supposed to have fallen in\nHampshire, Sept., 1852.\" It was an iron cannon ball, or it was a \"large\nnodule of iron pyrites or bisulphuret of iron.\" No one had seen it fall. It had been noticed, upon a garden path, for the first time, after a\nthunderstorm. It was only a \"supposed\" thing, because--\"It had not the\ncharacter of any known meteorite.\"\n\nIn the London _Times_, Sept. 16, 1852, appears a letter from Mr. George\nE. Bailey, a chemist of Andover, Hants. He says that, in a very heavy\nthunderstorm, of the first week of September, 1852, this iron object,\nhad fallen in the garden of Mr. Robert Dowling, of Andover; that it had\nfallen upon a path \"within six yards of the house.\" It had been picked\nup \"immediately\" after the storm by Mrs. Dowling. It was about the size\nof a cricket ball: weight four pounds. No one had seen it fall. In the\n_Times_, Sept.",

It was about the size\nof a cricket ball: weight four pounds. No one had seen it fall. In the\n_Times_, Sept. 15, 1852, there is an account of this thunderstorm, which\nwas of unusual violence. There are some other data relative to the ball of quartz of\nWestmoreland. They're poor things. There's so little to them that they\nlook like ghosts of the damned. However, ghosts, when multiplied, take\non what is called substantiality--if the solidest thing conceivable, in\nquasi-existence, is only concentrated phantomosity. It is not only that\nthere have been other reports of quartz that has fallen from the sky;\nthere is another agreement. The round quartz object of Westmoreland, if\nbroken open and separated from its loose nucleus, would be a round,\nhollow, quartz object. My pseudo-position is that two reports of similar\nextraordinary occurrences, one from England and one from Canada--are\ninteresting. _Proc. Canadian Institute_, 3-7-8:\n\nThat, at the meeting of the Institute, of Dec. 1, 1888, one of the\nmembers, Mr. J.A. Livingstone, exhibited a globular quartz body which he\nasserted had fallen from the sky. It had been split open. It was hollow. But the other members of the Institute decided that the object was\nspurious, because it was not of \"true meteoritic material.\"\n\nNo date; no place mentioned; we note the suggestion that it was only a\ngeode, which had been upon the ground in the first place. Its\ncrystalline lining was geode-like. Quartz is upon the \"index prohibitory\" of Science. A monk who would read\nDarwin would sin no more than would a scientist who would admit that,\nexcept by the \"up and down\" process, quartz has ever fallen from the\nsky--but Continuity: it is not excommunicated if part of or incorporated\nin a baptized meteorite--St. Catherine's of Mexico, I think. It's as\nepicurean a distinction as any ever made by theologians. Fassig lists a\nquartz pebble, found in a hailstone (_Bibliography_, part 2-355). \"Up\nand down,\" of course. Another object of quartzite was reported to have\nfallen, in the autumn of 1880, at Schroon Lake, N.Y.--said in the\n_Scientific American_, 43-272 to be a fraud--it was not--the usual. About the first of May, 1899, the newspapers published a story of a\n\"snow-white\" meteorite that had fallen, at Vincennes, Indiana. The\nEditor of the _Monthly Weather Review_ (issue of April, 1899) requested\nthe local observer, at Vincennes, to investigate. The Editor says that\nthe thing was only a fragment of a quartz boulder. He says that anyone\nwith at least a public school education should know better than to write\nthat quartz has ever fallen from the sky. _Notes and Queries_, 2-8-92:\n\nThat, in the Leyden Museum of Antiquities, there is a disk of quartz: 6\ncentimeters by 5 millimeters by about 5 centimeters; said to have fallen\nupon a plantation in the Dutch West Indies, after a meteoric explosion. Bricks. I think this is a vice we're writing. I recommend it to those who have\nhankered for a new sin. At first some of our data were of so frightful\nor ridiculous mien as to be hated, or eyebrowed, was only to be seen. Then some pity crept in? I think that we can now embrace bricks. The baked-clay-idea was all right in its place, but it rather lacks\ndistinction, I think. With our minds upon the concrete boats that have\nbeen building terrestrially lately, and thinking of wrecks that may\noccur to some of them, and of a new material for the deep-sea fishes to\ndisregard--\n\nObject that fell at Richland, South Carolina--yellow to gray--said to\nlook like a piece of brick. (_Amer. Jour. Sci._, 2-34-298.)\n\nPieces of \"furnace-made brick\" said to have fallen--in a hailstorm--at\nPadua, August, 1834. (_Edin. New Phil. Jour._, 19-87.) The writer\noffered an explanation that started another convention: that the\nfragments of brick had been knocked from buildings by the hailstones. But there is here a concomitant that will be disagreeable to anyone who\nmay have been inclined to smile at the now digestible--enough notion\nthat furnace-made bricks have fallen from the sky. It is that in some of\nthe hailstones--two per cent of them--that were found with the pieces of\nbrick, was a light grayish powder. _Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society_, 337-365:\n\nPadre Sechi explains that a stone said to have fallen, in a\nthunderstorm, at Supino, Italy, September, 1875, had been knocked from a\nroof. _Nature_, 33-153:\n\nThat it had been reported that a good-sized stone, of form clearly\nartificial, had fallen at Naples, November, 1885. The stone was\ndescribed by two professors of Naples, who had accepted it as\ninexplicable but veritable. They were visited by Dr. H. Johnstone-Lavis,\nthe correspondent to _Nature_, whose investigations had convinced him\nthat the object was a \"shoemaker's lapstone.\"\n\nNow to us of the initiated, or to us of the wider outlook, there is\nnothing incredible in the thought of shoemakers in other worlds--but I\nsuspect that this characterization is tactical.",

This object of worked stone, or this shoemaker's lapstone, was made of\nVesuvian lava, Dr. Johnstone-Lavis thinks: most probably of lava of the\nflow of 1631, from the La Scala quarries. We condemn \"most probably\" as\nbad positivism. As to the \"men of position,\" who had accepted that this\nthing had fallen from the sky--\"I have now obliged them to admit their\nmistake,\" says Dr. Johnstone-Lavis--or it's always the stranger in\nNaples who knows La Scala lava better than the natives know it. Explanation:\n\nThat the thing had been knocked from, or thrown from, a roof. As to attempt to trace the occurrence to any special roof--nothing said\nupon that subject. Or that Dr. Johnstone-Lavis called a carved stone a\n\"lapstone,\" quite as Mr. Symons called a spherical object a \"cannon\nball\": bent upon a discrediting incongruity:\n\nShoemaking and celestiality. It is so easy to say that axes, or wedge-shaped stones found on the\nground, were there in the first place, and that it is only coincidence\nthat lightning should strike near one--but the credibility of\ncoincidences decreases as the square root of their volume, I think. Our\nmassed instances speak too much of coincidences of coincidences. But the\naxes, or wedge-shaped objects that have been found in trees, are more\ndifficult for orthodoxy. For instance, Arago accepts that such finds\nhave occurred, but he argues that, if wedge-shaped stones have been\nfound in tree trunks, so have toads been found in tree trunks--did the\ntoads fall there? Not at all bad for a hypnotic. Of course, in our acceptance, the Irish are the Chosen People. It's\nbecause they are characteristically best in accord with the underlying\nessence of quasi-existence. M. Arago answers a question by asking\nanother question. That's the only way a question can be answered in our\nHibernian kind of an existence. Dr. Bodding argued with the natives of the Santal Parganas, India, who\nsaid that cut and shaped stones had fallen from the sky, some of them\nlodging in tree trunks. Dr. Bodding, with orthodox notions of velocity\nof falling bodies, having missed, I suppose, some of the notes I have\nupon large hailstones, which, for size, have fallen with astonishingly\nlow velocity, argued that anything falling from the sky would be\n\"smashed to atoms.\" He accepts that objects of worked stone have been\nfound in tree trunks, but he explains:\n\nThat the Santals often steal trees, but do not chop them down in the\nusual way, because that would be to make too much noise: they insert\nstone wedges, and hammer them instead: then, if they should be caught,\nwedges would not be the evidence against them that axes would be. Or that a scientific man can't be desperate and reasonable too. Or that a pickpocket, for instance, is safe, though caught with his hand\nin one's pocket, if he's gloved, say: because no court in the land would\nregard a gloved hand in the same way in which a bare hand would be\nregarded. That there's nothing but intermediateness to the rational and the\npreposterous: that this status of our own ratiocinations is perceptible\nwherein they are upon the unfamiliar. Dr. Bodding collected 50 of these shaped stones, said to have fallen\nfrom the sky, in the course of many years. He says that the Santals are\na highly developed race, and for ages have not used stone\nimplements--except in this one nefarious convenience to him. All explanations are localizations. They fade away before the universal. It is difficult to express that black rains in England do not originate\nin the smoke of factories--less difficult to express that black rains of\nSouth Africa do not. We utter little stress upon the absurdity of Dr. Bedding's explanation, because, if anything's absurd everything's\nabsurd, or, rather, has in it some degree or aspect of absurdity, and\nwe've never had experience with any state except something somewhere\nbetween ultimate absurdity and final reasonableness. Our acceptance is\nthat Dr. Bedding's elaborate explanation does not apply to cut-stone\nobjects found in tree trunks in other lands: we accept that for the\ngeneral, a local explanation is inadequate. As to \"thunderstones\" not said to have fallen luminously, and not said\nto have been found sticking in trees, we are told by faithful hypnotics\nthat astonished rustics come upon prehistoric axes that have been washed\ninto sight by rains, and jump to the conclusion that the things have\nfallen from the sky. But simple rustics come upon many prehistoric\nthings: scrapers, pottery, knives, hammers. We have no record of\nrusticity coming upon old pottery after a rain, reporting the fall of a\nbowl from the sky. Just now, my own acceptance is that wedge-shaped stone objects, formed\nby means similar to human workmanship, have often fallen from the sky. Maybe there are messages upon them.",

Just now, my own acceptance is that wedge-shaped stone objects, formed\nby means similar to human workmanship, have often fallen from the sky. Maybe there are messages upon them. My acceptance is that they have been\ncalled \"axes\" to discredit them: or the more familiar a term, the higher\nthe incongruity with vague concepts of the vast, remote, tremendous,\nunknown. In _Notes and Queries_, 2-8-92, a writer says that he had a\n\"thunderstone,\" which he had brought from Jamaica. The description is of\na wedge-shaped object; not of an ax:\n\n\"It shows no mark of having been attached to a handle.\"\n\nOf ten \"thunderstones,\" figured upon different pages in Blinkenberg's\nbook, nine show no sign of ever having been attached to a handle: one is\nperforated. But in a report by Dr. C. Leemans, Director of the Leyden Museum of\nAntiquities, objects, said by the Japanese to have fallen from the sky,\nare alluded to throughout as \"wedges.\" In the _Archaeologic Journal_,\n11-118, in a paper upon the \"thunderstones\" of Java, the objects are\ncalled \"wedges\" and not \"axes.\"\n\nOur notion is that rustics and savages call wedge-shaped objects that\nfall from the sky, \"axes\": that scientific men, when it suits their\npurposes, can resist temptations to prolixity and pedantry, and adopt\nthe simple: that they can be intelligible when derisive. All of which lands us in a confusion, worse, I think, than we were in\nbefore we so satisfactorily emerged from the distresses of--butter and\nblood and ink and paper and punk and silk. Now it's cannon balls and\naxes and disks--if a \"lapstone\" be a disk--it's a flat stone, at any\nrate. A great many scientists are good impressionists: they snub the\nimpertinences of details. Had he been of a coarse, grubbing nature, I\nthink Dr. Bodding could never have so simply and beautifully explained\nthe occurrence of stone wedges in tree trunks. But to a realist, the\nstory would be something like this:\n\nA man who needed a tree, in a land of jungles, where, for some unknown\nreason, everyone's very selfish with his trees, conceives that hammering\nstone wedges makes less noise than does the chopping of wood: he and his\ndescendants, in a course of many years, cut down trees with wedges, and\nescape penalty, because it never occurs to a prosecutor that the head of\nan ax is a wedge. The story is like every other attempted positivism--beautiful and\ncomplete, until we see what it excludes or disregards; whereupon it\nbecomes the ugly and incomplete--but not absolutely, because there is\nprobably something of what is called foundation for it. Perhaps a\nmentally incomplete Santal did once do something of the kind. Story told\nto Dr. Bodding: in the usual scientific way, he makes a dogma of an\naberration. Or we did have to utter a little stress upon this matter, after all. They're so hairy and attractive, these scientists of the the 19th century. We feel the zeal of a Sitting Bull when we think of their scalps. We\nshall have to have an expression of our own upon this confusing subject. We have expressions: we don't call them explanations: we've discarded\nexplanations with beliefs. Though everyone who scalps is, in the oneness\nof allness, himself likely to be scalped, there is such a discourtesy to\nan enemy as the wearing of wigs. Cannon balls and wedges, and what may they mean? Bombardments of this earth--\n\nAttempts to communicate--\n\nOr visitors to this earth, long ago--explorers from the moon--taking\nback with them, as curiosities, perhaps, implements of this earth's\nprehistoric inhabitants--a wreck--a cargo of such things held for ages\nin suspension in the Super-Sargasso Sea--falling, or shaken, down\noccasionally by storms--\n\nBut, by preponderance of description, we cannot accept that\n\"thunderstones\" ever were attached to handles, or are prehistoric axes--\n\nAs to attempts to communicate with this earth by means of wedge-shaped\nobjects especially adapted to the penetration of vast, gelatinous areas\nspread around this earth--\n\nIn the _Proc. Roy. Irish Acad._, 9-337, there is an account of a stone\nwedge that fell from the sky, near Cashel, Tipperary, Aug. 2, 1865. The\nphenomenon is not questioned, but the orthodox preference is to call it,\nnot ax-like, nor wedge-shaped, but \"pyramidal.\" For data of other\npyramidal stones said to have fallen from the sky, see _Rept. Brit. Assoc._, 1861-34. One fell at Segowolee, India, about 1853. Of the\nobject that fell at Cashel, Dr. Haughton says in the _Proceedings_: \"A\nsingular feature is observable in this stone, that I have never seen in\nany other:--the rounded edges of the pyramid are sharply marked by lines\non the black crust, as perfect as if made by a ruler.\" Dr. Haughton's\nidea is that the marks may have been made by \"some peculiar tension in\nthe cooling.\" It must have been very peculiar, if in all aerolites not\nwedge-shaped, no such phenomenon had ever been observed. It merges away\nwith one or two instances known, after Dr.",

It merges away\nwith one or two instances known, after Dr. Haughton's time, of seeming\nstratification in meteorites. Stratification in meteorites, however, is\ndenied by the faithful. I begin to suspect something else. A whopper is coming. Later it will be as reasonable, by familiarity, as anything else ever\nsaid. If someone should study the stone of Cashel, as Champollion studied the\nRosetta stone, he might--or, rather, would inevitably--find meaning in\nthose lines, and translate them into English--\n\nNevertheless I begin to suspect something else: something more subtle\nand esoteric than graven characters upon stones that have fallen from\nthe sky, in attempts to communicate. The notion that other worlds are\nattempting to communicate with this world is widespread: my own notion\nis that it is not attempt at all--that it was achievement centuries ago. I should like to send out a report that a \"thunderstone\" had fallen,\nsay, somewhere in New Hampshire--\n\nAnd keep track of every person who came to examine that stone--trace\ndown his affiliations--keep track of him--\n\nThen send out a report that a \"thunderstone\" had fallen at Stockholm,\nsay--\n\nWould one of the persons who had gone to New Hampshire, be met again in\nStockholm? But--what if he had no anthropological, lapidarian, or\nmeteorological affiliations--but did belong to a secret society--\n\nIt is only a dawning credulity. Of the three forms of symmetric objects that have, or haven't, fallen\nfrom the sky, it seems to me that the disk is the most striking. So\nfar, in this respect, we have been at our worst--possibly that's pretty\nbad--but \"lapstones\" are likely to be of considerable variety of form,\nand something that is said to have fallen at sometime somewhere in the\nDutch West Indies is profoundly of the unchosen. Now we shall have something that is high up in the castes of the\naccursed:\n\n_Comptes Rendus_, 1887-182:\n\nThat, upon late in the decade of the 1880s, in a \"violent storm\"--two months before the\nreported fall of the symmetric iron object of Brixton--a small stone had\nfallen from the sky at Tarbes, France: 13 millimeters in diameter; 5\nmillimeters thick; weight 2 grammes. Reported to the French Academy by\nM. Sudre, professor of the Normal School, Tarbes. This time the old convenience \"there in the first place\" is too greatly\nresisted--the stone was covered with ice. This object had been cut and shaped by means similar to human hands and\nhuman mentality. It was a disk of worked stone--\"tres regulier.\" \"Il a\n\u00e9t\u00e9 assurement travaill\u00e9.\"\n\nThere's not a word as to any known whirlwind anywhere: nothing of other\nobjects or d\u00e9bris that fell at or near this date, in France. The thing\nhad fallen alone. But as mechanically as any part of a machine responds\nto its stimulus, the explanation appears in _Comptes Rendus_ that this\nstone had been raised by a whirlwind and then flung down. It may be that in the whole nineteenth century no event more important\nthan this occurred. In _La Nature_, 1887, and in _L'Ann\u00e9e Scientifique_,\n1887, this occurrence is noted. It is mentioned in one of the summer\nnumbers of _Nature_, 1887. Fassig lists a paper upon it in the _Annuaire\nde Soc. Met._, 1887. Not a word of discussion. Not a subsequent mention can I find. Our own expression:\n\nWhat matters it how we, the French Academy, or the Salvation Army may\nexplain? A disk of worked stone fell from the sky, at Tarbes, France, about 1887. My own pseudo-conclusion:\n\nThat we've been damned by giants sound asleep, or by great scientific\nprinciples and abstractions that cannot realize themselves: that little\nharlots have visited their caprices upon us; that clowns, with buckets\nof water from which they pretend to cast thousands of good-sized fishes\nhave anathematized us for laughing disrespectfully, because, as with all\nclowns, underlying buffoonery is the desire to be taken seriously; that\npale ignorances, presiding over microscopes by which they cannot\ndistinguish flesh from nostoc or fishes' spawn or frogs' spawn, have\nvisited upon us their wan solemnities. We've been damned by corpses and\nskeletons and mummies, which twitch and totter with pseudo-life derived\nfrom conveniences. Or there is only hypnosis. The accursed are those who admit they're the\naccursed. If we be more nearly real we are reasons arraigned before a jury of\ndream-phantasms. Of all meteorites in museums, very few were seen to fall. It is\nconsidered sufficient grounds for admission if specimens can't be\naccounted for in any way other than that they fell from the sky--as if\nin the haze of uncertainty that surrounds all things, or that is the\nessence of everything, or in the merging away of everything into\nsomething else, there could be anything that could be accounted for in\nonly one way. The scientist and the theologian reason that if something\ncan be accounted for in only one way, it is accounted for in that\nway--or logic would be logical, if the conditions that it imposes, but,\nof course, does not insist upon, could anywhere be found in\nquasi-existence.",

In our acceptance, logic, science, art, religion are,\nin our \"existence,\" premonitions of a coming awakening, like dawning\nawarenesses of surroundings in the mind of a dreamer. Any old chunk of metal that measures up to the standard of \"true\nmeteoritic material\" is admitted by the museums. It may seem incredible\nthat modern curators still have this delusion, but we suspect that the\ndate on one's morning newspaper hasn't much to do with one's modernity\nall day long. In reading Fletcher's catalogue, for instance, we learn\nthat some of the best-known meteorites were \"found in draining a\nfield\"--\"found in making a road\"--\"turned up by the plow\" occurs a dozen\ntimes. Someone fishing in Lake Okeechobee, brought up an object in his\nfishing net. No meteorite had ever been seen to fall near it. The U.S. National Museum accepts it. If we have accepted only one of the data of \"untrue meteoritic\nmaterial\"--one instance of \"carbonaceous\" matter--if it be too difficult\nto utter the word \"coal\"--we see that in this inclusion-exclusion, as in\nevery other means of forming an opinion, false inclusion and false\nexclusion have been practiced by curators of museums. There is something of ultra-pathos--of cosmic sadness--in this universal\nsearch for a standard, and in belief that one has been revealed by\neither inspiration or analysis, then the dogged clinging to a poor sham\nof a thing long after its insufficiency has been shown--or renewed hope\nand search for the special that can be true, or for something local that\ncould also be universal. It's as if \"true meteoritic material\" were a\n\"rock of ages\" to some scientific men. They cling. But clingers cannot\nhold out welcoming arms. The only seemingly conclusive utterance, or seemingly substantial thing\nto cling to, is a product of dishonesty, ignorance, or fatigue. All\nsciences go back and back, until they're worn out with the process, or\nuntil mechanical reaction occurs: then they move forward--as it were. Then they become dogmatic, and take for bases, positions that were only\npoints of exhaustion. So chemistry divided and sub-divided down to\natoms; then, in the essential insecurity of all quasi-constructions, it\nbuilt up a system, which, to anyone so obsessed by his own hypnoses that\nhe is exempt to the chemist's hypnoses, is perceptibly enough an\nintellectual an\u00e6mia built upon infinitesimal debilities. In _Science_, n.s., 31-298, E.D. Hovey, of the American Museum of\nNatural History, asserts or confesses that often have objects of\nmaterial such as fossiliferous limestone and slag been sent to him He\nsays that these things have been accompanied by assurances that they\nhave been seen to fall on lawns, on roads, in front of houses. They are all excluded. They are not of true meteoritic material. They\nwere on the ground in the first place. It is only by coincidence that\nlightning has struck, or that a real meteorite, which was unfindable,\nhas struck near objects of slag and limestone. Mr. Hovey says that the list might be extended indefinitely. That's a\ntantalizing suggestion of some very interesting stuff--\n\nHe says:\n\n\"But it is not worth while.\"\n\nI'd like to know what strange, damned, excommunicated things have been\nsent to museums by persons who have felt convinced that they had seen\nwhat they may have seen, strongly enough to risk ridicule, to make up\nbundles, go to express offices, and write letters. I accept that over\nthe door of every museum, into which such things enter, is written:\n\n\"Abandon Hope.\"\n\nIf a Mr. Symons mentions one instance of coal, or of slag or cinders,\nsaid to have fallen from the sky, we are not--except by association with\nthe \"carbonaceous\" meteorites--strong in our impression that coal\nsometimes falls to this earth from coal-burning super-constructions up\nsomewhere--\n\nIn _Comptes Rendus_, 91-197, M. Daubr\u00e9e tells the same story. Our\nacceptance, then, is that other curators could tell this same story. Then the phantomosity of our impression substantiates proportionately to\nits multiplicity. M.

That would be of the\nPositive Absolute, and, though the ideal of, a violation of, the very\nessence of quasi-existence, wherein only to have the appearance of being\nis to express a preponderance of force one way or another--or\ninequilibrium, or inconsistency, or injustice.

An orthodox demonstration, in terms of which we shall have some\nheresies, is that if things found in coal could have got there only by\nfalling there--they fell there. So, in the _Manchester Lit. and Phil. Soc. Mems._, 2-9-306, it is argued\nthat certain roundish stones that have been found in coal are \"fossil\naerolites\": that they had fallen from the sky, ages ago, when the coal\nwas soft, because the coal had closed around them, showing no sign of\nentrance. _Proc. Soc. of Antiq. of Scotland_, 1-1-121:\n\nThat, in a lump of coal, from a mine in Scotland, an iron instrument had\nbeen found--\n\n\"The interest attaching to this singular relic arises from the fact of\nits having been found in the heart of a piece of coal, seven feet under\nthe surface.\"\n\nIf we accept that this object of iron was of workmanship beyond the\nmeans and skill of the primitive men who may have lived in Scotland when\ncoal was forming there--\n\n\"The instrument was considered to be modern.\"\n\nThat our expression has more of realness, or higher approximation to\nrealness, than has the attempt to explain that is made in the\n_Proceedings_:\n\nThat in modern times someone may have bored for coal, and that his drill\nmay have broken off in the coal it had penetrated. Why he should have abandoned such easily accessible coal, I don't know. The important point is that there was no sign of boring: that this\ninstrument was in a lump of coal that had closed around it so that its\npresence was not suspected, until the lump of coal was broken. No mention can I find of this damned thing in any other publication. Of\ncourse there is an alternative here: the thing may not have fallen from\nthe sky: if in coal-forming times, in Scotland, there were, indigenous\nto this earth, no men capable of making such an iron instrument, it may\nhave been left behind by visitors from other worlds. In an extraordinary approximation to fairness and justice, which is\npermitted to us, because we are quite as desirous to make acceptable\nthat nothing can be proved as we are to sustain our own expressions, we\nnote:\n\nThat in _Notes and Queries_, 11-1-408, there is an account of an ancient\ncopper seal, about the size of a penny, found in chalk, at a depth of\nfrom five to six feet, near Bredenstone, England. The design upon it is\nsaid to be of a monk kneeling before a virgin and child: a legend upon\nthe margin is said to be: \"St. Jordanis Monachi Spaldingie.\"\n\nI don't know about that. It looks very desirable--undesirable to us. There's a wretch of an ultra-frowsy thing in the _Scientific American_,\n7-298, which we condemn ourselves, if somewhere, because of the oneness\nof allness, the damned must also be the damning. It's a newspaper story:\nthat about the first of June, 1851, a powerful blast, near Dorchester,\nMass., cast out from a bed of solid rock a bell-shaped vessel of an\nunknown metal: floral designs inlaid with silver; \"art of some cunning\nworkman.\" The opinion of the Editor of the _Scientific American_ is that\nthe thing had been made by Tubal Cain, who was the first inhabitant of\nDorchester. Though I fear that this is a little arbitrary, I am not\ndisposed to fly rabidly at every scientific opinion. _Nature_, 35-36:\n\nA block of metal found in coal, in Austria, 1885. It is now in the\nSalsburg museum. This time we have another expression. Usually our intermediatist attack\nupon provincial positivism is: Science, in its attempted positivism\ntakes something such as \"true meteoritic material\" as a standard of\njudgment; but carbonaceous matter, except for its relative infrequency,\nis just as veritable a standard of judgment; carbonaceous matter merges\naway into such a variety of organic substances, that all standards are\nreduced to indistinguishability: if, then, there is no real standard\nagainst us, there is no real resistance to our own acceptances. Now our\nintermediatism is: Science takes \"true meteoritic material\" as a\nstandard of admission; but now we have an instance that quite as truly\nmakes \"true meteoritic material\" a standard of exclusion; or, then, a\nthing that denies itself is no real resistance to our own\nacceptances--this depending upon whether we have a datum of something of\n\"true meteoritic material\" that orthodoxy can never accept fell from the\nsky. We're a little involved here.",

We're a little involved here. Our own acceptance is upon a carved,\ngeometric thing that, if found in a very old deposit, antedates human\nlife, except, perhaps, very primitive human life, as an indigenous\nproduct of this earth: but we're quite as much interested in the dilemma\nit made for the faithful. It is of \"true meteoritic material.\" _L'Astronomie_, 1887-114, it is\nsaid that, though so geometric, its phenomena so characteristic of\nmeteorites exclude the idea that it was the work of man. As to the deposit--Tertiary coal. Composition--iron, carbon, and a small quantity of nickel. It has the pitted surface that is supposed by the faithful to be\ncharacteristic of meteorites. For a full account of this subject, see _Comptes Rendus_, 103-702. The\nscientists who examined it could reach no agreement. They bifurcated:\nthen a compromise was suggested; but the compromise is a product of\ndisregard:\n\nThat it was of true meteoritic material, and had not been shaped by man;\n\nThat it was not of true meteoritic material, but telluric iron that had\nbeen shaped by man:\n\nThat it was true meteoritic material that had fallen from the sky, but\nhad been shaped by man, after its fall. The data, one or more of which must be disregarded by each of these\nthree explanations, are: \"true meteoritic material\" and surface markings\nof meteorites; geometric form; presence in an ancient deposit; material\nas hard as steel; absence upon this earth, in Tertiary times, of men who\ncould work in material as hard as steel. It is said that, though of\n\"true meteoritic material,\" this object is virtually a steel object. St. Augustine, with his orthodoxy, was never in--well, very much\nworse--difficulties than are the faithful here. By due disregard of a\ndatum or so, our own acceptance that it was a steel object that had\nfallen from the sky to this earth, in Tertiary times, is not forced upon\none. We offer ours as the only synthetic expression. For instance, in\n_Science Gossip_, 1887-58, it is described as a meteorite: in this\naccount there is nothing alarming to the pious, because, though\neverything else is told, its geometric form is not mentioned. It's a cube. There is a deep incision all around it. Of its faces, two\nthat are opposite are rounded. Though I accept that our own expression can only rather approximate to\nTruth, by the wideness of its inclusions, and because it seems, of four\nattempts, to represent the only complete synthesis, and can be nullified\nor greatly modified by data that we, too, have somewhere disregarded,\nthe only means of nullification that I can think of would be\ndemonstration that this object is a mass of iron pyrites, which\nsometimes forms geometrically. But the analysis mentions not a trace of\nsulphur. Of course our weakness, or impositiveness, lies in that, by\nanyone to whom it would be agreeable to find sulphur in this thing,\nsulphur would be found in it--by our own intermediatism there is some\nsulphur in everything, or sulphur is only a localization or emphasis of\nsomething that, unemphasized, is in all things. So there have, or haven't, been found upon this earth things that fell\nfrom the sky, or that were left behind by extra-mundane visitors to this\nearth--\n\nA yarn in the London _Times_, in the middle of the decade of the 1840s: that some workmen,\nquarrying rock, close to the Tweed, about a quarter of a mile below\nRutherford Mills, discovered a gold thread embedded in the stone at a\ndepth of 8 feet: that a piece of the gold thread had been sent to the\noffice of the _Kelso Chronicle_. Pretty little thing; not at all frowsy; rather damnable. London _Times_, Dec. 24, 1851:\n\nThat Hiram De Witt, of Springfield, Mass., returning from California,\nhad brought with him a piece of auriferous quartz about the size of a\nman's fist. It was accidentally dropped--split open--nail in it. There\nwas a cut-iron nail, size of a six-penny nail, slightly corroded. \"It\nwas entirely straight and had a perfect head.\"\n\nOr--California--ages ago, when auriferous quartz was\nforming--super-carpenter, million of miles or so up in the air--drops a\nnail. To one not an intermediatist, it would seem incredible that this datum,\nnot only of the damned, but of the lowest of the damned, or of the\njournalistic caste of the accursed, could merge away with something else\ndamned only by disregard, and backed by what is called \"highest\nscientific authority\"--\n\nCommunication by Sir David Brewster (_Rept. Brit. Assoc._, 1845-51):\n\nThat a nail had been found in a block of stone from Kingoodie Quarry,\nNorth Britain.

The block in which the nail was found was nine inches\nthick, but as to what part of the quarry it had come from, there is no\nevidence--except that it could not have been from the surface. The\nquarry had been worked about twenty years. It consisted of alternate\nlayers of hard stone and a substance called \"till.\" The point of the\nnail, quite eaten with rust, projected into some \"till,\" upon the\nsurface of the block of stone. The rest of the nail lay upon the surface\nof the stone to within an inch of the head--that inch of it was embedded\nin the stone. Although its caste is high, this is a thing profoundly of the\ndamned--sort of a Brahmin as regarded by a Baptist. Its case was stated\nfairly; Brewster related all circumstances available to him--but there\nwas no discussion at the meeting of the British Association: no\nexplanation was offered--\n\nNevertheless the thing can be nullified--\n\nBut the nullification that we find is as much against orthodoxy in one\nrespect as it is against our own expression that inclusion in quartz or\nsandstone indicates antiquity--or there would have to be a revision of\nprevailing dogmas upon quartz and sandstone and age indicated by them,\nif the opposing data should be accepted. Of course it may be contended\nby both the orthodox and us heretics that the opposition is only a yarn\nfrom a newspaper. By an odd combination, we find our two lost souls that\nhave tried to emerge, chucked back to perdition by one blow:\n\n_Pop. Sci. News_, 1884-41:\n\nThat, according to the _Carson Appeal_, there had been found in a mine,\nquartz crystals that could have had only 15 years in which to form:\nthat, where a mill had been built, sandstone had been found, when the\nmill was torn down, that had hardened in 12 years: that in this\nsandstone was a piece of wood \"with a nail in it.\"\n\n_Annals of Scientific Discovery_, 1853-71:\n\nThat, at the meeting of the British Association, 1853, Sir David\nBrewster had announced that he had to bring before the meeting an object\n\"of so incredible a nature that nothing short of the strongest evidence\nwas necessary to render the statement at all probable.\"\n\nA crystal lens had been found in the treasure-house at Nineveh. In many of the temples and treasure houses of old civilizations upon\nthis earth have been preserved things that have fallen from the sky--or\nmeteorites. Again we have a Brahmin. This thing is buried alive in the heart of\npropriety: it is in the British Museum. Carpenter, in _The Microscope and Its Revelations_, gives two drawings\nof it. Carpenter argues that it is impossible to accept that optical\nlenses had ever been made by the ancients. Never occurred to\nhim--someone a million miles or so up in the air--looking through his\ntelescope--lens drops out. This does not appeal to Carpenter: he says that this object must have\nbeen an ornament. According to Brewster, it was not an ornament, but \"a true optical\nlens.\"\n\nIn that case, in ruins of an old civilization upon this earth, has been\nfound an accursed thing that was, acceptably, not a product of any old\ncivilization indigenous to this earth. Early explorers have Florida mixed up with Newfoundland. But the\nconfusion is worse than that still earlier. It arises from simplicity. Very early explorers think that all land westward is one land, India:\nawareness of other lands as well as India comes as a slow process. I do\nnot now think of things arriving upon this earth from some especial\nother world. That was my notion when I started to collect our data. Or,\nas is a commonplace of observation, all intellection begins with the\nillusion of homogeneity. It's one of Spencer's data: we see\nhomogeneousness in all things distant, or with which we have small\nacquaintance. Advance from the relatively homogeneous to the relatively\nheterogeneous is Spencerian Philosophy--like everything else, so-called:\nnot that it was really Spencer's discovery, but was taken from von Baer,\nwho, in turn, was continuous with preceding evolutionary speculation. Our own expression is that all things are acting to advance to the\nhomogeneous, or are trying to localize Homogeneousness. Homogeneousness\nis an aspect of the Universal, wherein it is a state that does not merge\naway into something else. We regard homogeneousness as an aspect of\npositiveness, but it is our acceptance that infinite frustrations of\nattempts to positivize manifest themselves in infinite heterogeneity: so\nthat though things try to localize homogeneousness they end up in\nheterogeneity so great that it amounts to infinite dispersion or\nindistinguishability.",

So all concepts are little attempted positivenesses, but soon have to\ngive in to compromise, modification, nullification, merging away into\nindistinguishability--unless, here and there, in the world's history,\nthere may have been a super-dogmatist, who, for only an infinitesimal of\ntime, has been able to hold out against heterogeneity or modification or\ndoubt or \"listening to reason,\" or loss of identity--in which\ncase--instant translation to heaven or the Positive Absolute. Odd thing about Spencer is that he never recognized that \"homogeneity,\"\n\"integration,\" and \"definiteness\" are all words for the same state, or\nthe state that we call \"positiveness.\" What we call his mistake is in\nthat he regarded \"homogeneousness\" as negative. I began with a notion of some one other world, from which objects and\nsubstances have fallen to this earth; which had, or which, to less\ndegree, has a tutelary interest in this earth; which is now attempting\nto communicate with this earth--modifying, because of data which will\npile up later, into acceptance that some other world is not attempting\nbut has been, for centuries, in communication with a sect, perhaps, or a\nsecret society, or certain esoteric ones of this earth's inhabitants. I lose a great deal of hypnotic power in not being able to concentrate\nattention upon some one other world. As I have admitted before I'm intelligent, as contrasted with the\northodox. I haven't the aristocratic disregard of a New York curator or\nan Eskimo medicine-man. I have to dissipate myself in acceptance of a host of other worlds: size\nof the moon, some of them: one of them, at least--tremendous thing:\nwe'll take that up later. Vast, amorphous aerial regions, to which such\ndefinite words as \"worlds\" and \"planets\" seem inapplicable. And\nartificial constructions that I have called \"super-constructions\": one\nof them about the size of Brooklyn, I should say, offhand. And one or\nmore of them wheel-shaped things a goodly number of square miles in\narea. I think that earlier in this book, before we liberalized into embracing\neverything that comes along, your indignation, or indigestion would have\nexpressed in the notion that, if this were so, astronomers would have\nseen these other worlds and regions and vast geometric constructions. You'd have had that notion: you'd have stopped there. But the attempt to stop is saying \"enough\" to the insatiable. In cosmic\npunctuation there are no periods: illusion of periods is incomplete view\nof colons and semi-colons. We can't stop with the notion that if there were such phenomena,\nastronomers would have seen them. Because of our experience with\nsuppression and disregard, we suspect, before we go into the subject at\nall, that astronomers have seen them; that navigators and meteorologists\nhave seen them; that individual scientists and other trained observers\nhave seen them many times--\n\nThat it is the System that has excluded data of them. As to the Law of Gravitation, and astronomers' formulas, remember that\nthese formulas worked out in the time of Laplace as well as they do now. But there are hundreds of planetary bodies now known that were then not\nknown. So a few hundred worlds more of ours won't make any difference. Laplace knew of about only thirty bodies in this solar system: about six\nhundred are recognized now--\n\nWhat are the discoveries of geology and biology to a theologian? His formulas still work out as well as they ever did. If the Law of Gravitation could be stated as a real utterance, it might\nbe a real resistance to us. But we are told only that gravitation is\ngravitation. Of course to an intermediatist, nothing can be defined\nexcept in terms of itself--but even the orthodox, in what seems to me to\nbe the innate premonitions of realness, not founded upon experience,\nagree that to define a thing in terms of itself is not real definition. It is said that by gravitation is meant the attraction of all things\nproportionately to mass and inversely as the square of the distance. Mass would mean inter-attraction holding together final particles, if\nthere were final particles. Then, until final particles be discovered,\nonly one term of this expression survives, or mass is attraction. But\ndistance is only extent of mass, unless one holds out for absolute\nvacuum among planets, a position against which we could bring a host of\ndata. But there is no possible means of expressing that gravitation is\nanything other than attraction. So there is nothing to resist us but\nsuch a phantom as--that gravitation is the gravitation of all\ngravitations proportionately to gravitation and inversely as the square\nof gravitation. In a quasi-existence, nothing more sensible than this\ncan be said upon any so-called subject--perhaps there are higher\napproximations to ultimate sensibleness. Nevertheless we seem to have a feeling that with the System against us\nwe have a kind of resistance here.",

Nevertheless we seem to have a feeling that with the System against us\nwe have a kind of resistance here. We'd have felt so formerly, at any\nrate: I think the Dr. Grays and Prof. Hitchcocks have modified our\ntrustfulness toward indistinguishability. As to the perfection of this\nSystem that quasi-opposes us and the infallibility of its\nmathematics--as if there could be real mathematics in a mode of seeming\nwhere twice two are not four--we've been told over and over of their\nvindication in the discovery of Neptune. I'm afraid that the course we're taking will turn out like every other\ndevelopment. We began humbly, admitting that we're of the damned--\n\nBut our eyebrows--\n\nJust a faint flicker in them, or in one of them, every time we hear of\nthe \"triumphal discovery of Neptune\"--this \"monumental achievement of\ntheoretical astronomy,\" as the text-books call it. The whole trouble is that we've looked it up. The text-books omit this:\n\nThat, instead of the orbit of Neptune agreeing with the calculations of\nAdams and Leverrier, it was so different--that Leverrier said that it\nwas not the planet of his calculations. Later it was thought best to say no more upon that subject. The text-books omit this:\n\nThat, in 1846, everyone who knew a sine from a cosine was out sining and\ncosining for a planet beyond Uranus. Two of them guessed right. To some minds, even after Leverrier's own rejection of Neptune, the word\n\"guessed\" may be objectionable--but, according to Prof. Peirce, of\nHarvard, the calculations of Adams and Leverrier would have applied\nquite as well to positions many degrees from the position of Neptune. Or for Prof. Peirce's demonstration that the discovery of Neptune was\nonly a \"happy accident,\" see _Proc. Amer. Acad. Sciences_, 1-65. For references, see Lowell's _Evolution of Worlds_. Or comets: another nebulous resistance to our own notions. As to\neclipses, I have notes upon several of them that did not occur upon\nscheduled time, though with differences only of seconds--and one\ndelightful lost soul, deep-buried, but buried in the ultra-respectable\nrecords of the Royal Astronomical Society, upon an eclipse that did not\noccur at all. That delightful, ultra-sponsored thing of perdition is too\ngood and malicious to be dismissed with passing notice: we'll have him\nlater. Throughout the history of astronomy, every comet that has come back upon\npredicted time--not that, essentially, there was anything more abstruse\nabout it than is a prediction that you can make of a postman's\nperiodicities tomorrow--was advertised for all it was worth. It's the\nway reputations are worked up for fortune-tellers by the faithful. The\ncomets that didn't come back--omitted or explained. Or Encke's comet. It\ncame back slower and slower. But the astronomers explained. Be almost\nabsolutely sure of that: they explained. They had it all worked out and\nformulated and \"proved\" why that comet was coming back slower and\nslower--and there the damn thing began coming faster and faster. Halley's comet. Astronomy--\"the perfect science, as we astronomers like to call it.\"\n(Jacoby.)\n\nIt's my own notion that if, in a real existence, an astronomer could not\ntell one longitude from another, he'd be sent back to this purgatory of\nours until he could meet that simple requirement. Halley was sent to the Cape of Good Hope to determine its longitude. He\ngot it degrees wrong. He gave to Africa's noble Roman promontory a\nretrouss\u00e9 twist that would take the pride out of any Kaffir. We hear everlastingly of Halley's comet. It came back--maybe. But,\nunless we look the matter up in contemporaneous records, we hear nothing\nof--the Leonids, for instance. By the same methods as those by which\nHalley's comet was predicted, the Leonids were predicted. November,\n1898--no Leonids. It was explained. They had been perturbed. They would\nappear in November, 1899. November, 1899--November, 1900--no Leonids. My notion of astronomic accuracy:\n\nWho could not be a prize marksman, if only his hits be recorded? As to Halley's comet, of 1910--everybody now swears he saw it. He has to\nperjure himself: otherwise he'd be accused of having no interest in\ngreat, inspiring things that he's never given any attention to. Regard this:\n\nThat there never is a moment when there is not some comet in the sky. Virtually there is no year in which several new comets are not\ndiscovered, so plentiful are they. Luminous fleas on a vast black\ndog--in popular impressions, there is no realization of the extent to\nwhich this solar system is flea-bitten. If a comet have not the orbit that astronomers have\npredicted--perturbed. If--like Halley's comet--it be late--even a year\nlate--perturbed. When a train is an hour late, we have small opinion of\nthe predictions of timetables. When a comet's a year late, all we ask\nis--that it be explained. We hear of the inflation and arrogance of\nastronomers. My own acceptance is not that they are imposing upon us:\nthat they are requiting us. For many of us priests no longer function to\ngive us seeming rapport with Perfection, Infallibility--the Positive\nAbsolute.",

Suppose the comet called\nHalley's had not appeared--\n\nEarly in 1910, a far more important comet than the an\u00e6mic luminosity\nsaid to be Halley's, appeared. It was so brilliant that it was visible\nin daylight. The astronomers would have been saved anyway. If this other\ncomet did not have the predicted orbit--perturbation. If you're going to\nConey Island, and predict there'll be a special kind of a pebble on the\nbeach, I don't see how you can disgrace yourself, if some other pebble\nwill do just as well--because the feeble thing said to have been seen in\n1910 was no more in accord with the sensational descriptions given out\nby astronomers in advance than is a pale pebble with a brick-red\nboulder. I predict that next Wednesday, a large Chinaman, in evening clothes,\nwill cross Broadway, at 42nd Street, at 9 P.M. He doesn't, but a\ntubercular Jap in a sailor's uniform does cross Broadway, at 35th\nStreet, Friday, at noon. Well, a Jap is a perturbed Chinaman, and\nclothes are clothes. I remember the terrifying predictions made by the honest and credulous\nastronomers, who must have been themselves hypnotized, or they could not\nhave hypnotized the rest of us, in 1909. Wills were made. Human life\nmight be swept from this planet. In quasi-existence, which is\nessentially Hibernian, that would be no reason why wills should not be\nmade. The less excitable of us did expect at least some pretty good\nfireworks. I have to admit that it is said that, in New York, a light was seen in\nthe sky. It was about as terrifying as the scratch of a match on the seat of some\nbreeches half a mile away. It was not on time. Though I have heard that a faint nebulosity, which I did not see,\nmyself, though I looked when I was told to look, was seen in the sky, it\nappeared several days after the time predicted. A hypnotized host of imbeciles of us: told to look up at the sky: we\ndid--like a lot of pointers hypnotized by a partridge. The effect:\n\nAlmost everybody now swears that he saw Halley's comet, and that it was\na glorious spectacle. An interesting circumstance here is that seemingly we are trying to\ndiscredit astronomers because astronomers oppose us--that's not my\nimpression. We shall be in the Brahmin caste of the hell of the\nBaptists. Almost all our data, in some regiments of this procession, are\nobservations by astronomers, few of them mere amateur astronomers. It is\nthe System that opposes us. It is the System that is suppressing\nastronomers. I think we pity them in their captivity. Ours is not\nmalice--in a positive sense. It's chivalry--somewhat. Unhappy\nastronomers looking out from high towers in which they are\nimprisoned--we appear upon the horizon. But, as I have said, our data do not relate to some especial other\nworld. I mean very much what a savage upon an ocean island might\nvaguely think of in his speculations--not upon some other land, but\ncomplexes of continents and their phenomena: cities, factories in\ncities, means of communication--\n\nNow all the other savages would know of a few vessels sailing in their\nregular routes, passing this island in regularized periodicities. The\ntendency in these minds would be expression of the universal tendency\ntoward positivism--or Completeness--or conviction that these few\nregularized vessels constituted all. Now I think of some especial savage\nwho suspects otherwise--because he's very backward and unimaginative and\ninsensible to the beautiful ideals of the others: not piously occupied,\nlike the others, in bowing before impressive-looking sticks of wood;\ndishonestly taking time for his speculations, while the others are\npatriotically witch-finding. So the other higher and nobler savages know\nabout the few regularized vessels: know when to expect them; have their\nperiodicities all worked out; just about when vessels will pass, or\neclipse each other--explaining that all vagaries were due to atmospheric\nconditions. They'd come out strong in explaining. You can't read a book upon savages without noting what resolute\nexplainers they are.",

They'd come out strong in explaining. You can't read a book upon savages without noting what resolute\nexplainers they are. They'd say that all this mechanism was founded upon the mutual\nattraction of the vessels--deduced from the fall of a monkey from a palm\ntree--or, if not that, that devils were pushing the vessels--something\nof the kind. Storms. D\u00e9bris, not from these vessels, cast up by the waves. Disregarded. How can one think of something and something else, too? I'm in the state of mind of a savage who might find upon a shore, washed\nup by the same storm, buoyant parts of a piano and a paddle that was\ncarved by cruder hands than his own: something light and summery from\nIndia, and a fur overcoat from Russia--or all science, though\napproximating wider and wider, is attempt to conceive of India in terms\nof an ocean island, and of Russia in terms of India so interpreted. Though I am trying to think of Russia and India in world-wide terms, I\ncannot think that that, or the universalizing of the local, is cosmic\npurpose. The higher idealist is the positivist who tries to localize\nthe universal, and is in accord with cosmic purpose: the super-dogmatist\nof a local savage who can hold out, without a flurry of doubt, that a\npiano washed up on a beach is the trunk of a palm tree that a shark has\nbitten, leaving his teeth in it. So we fear for the soul of Dr. Gray,\nbecause he did not devote his whole life to that one stand that, whether\npossible or inconceivable, thousands of fishes had been cast from one\nbucket. So, unfortunately for myself, if salvation be desirable, I look out\nwidely but amorphously, indefinitely and heterogeneously. If I say I\nconceive of another world that is now in secret communication with\ncertain esoteric inhabitants of this earth, I say I conceive of still\nother worlds that are trying to establish communication with all the\ninhabitants of this earth. I fit my notions to the data I find. That is\nsupposed to be the right and logical and scientific thing to do; but it\nis no way to approximate to form, system, organization. Then I think I\nconceive of other worlds and vast structures that pass us by, within a\nfew miles, without the slightest desire to communicate, quite as tramp\nvessels pass many islands without particularizing one from another. Then\nI think I have data of a vast construction that has often come to this\nearth, dipped into an ocean, submerged there a while, then going\naway--Why? I'm not absolutely sure. How would an Eskimo explain a\nvessel, sending ashore for coal, which is plentiful upon some Arctic\nbeaches, though of unknown use to the natives, then sailing away, with\nno interest in the natives? A great difficulty in trying to understand vast constructions that show\nno interest in us:\n\nThe notion that we must be interesting. I accept that, though we're usually avoided, probably for moral reasons,\nsometimes this earth has been visited by explorers. I think that the\nnotion that there have been extra-mundane visitors to China, within what\nwe call the historic period, will be only ordinarily absurd, when we\ncome to that datum. I accept that some of the other worlds are of conditions very similar to\nour own. I think of others that are very different--so that visitors\nfrom them could not live here--without artificial adaptations. How some of them could breathe our attenuated air, if they came from a\ngelatinous atmosphere--\n\nMasks. The masks that have been found in ancient deposits. Most of them are of stone, and are said to have been ceremonial regalia\nof savages--\n\nBut the mask that was found in Sullivan County, Missouri, in 1879\n(_American Antiquarian_, 3-336). It is made of iron and silver. One of the damnedest in our whole saturnalia of the accursed--\n\nBecause it is hopeless to try to shake off an excommunication only by\nsaying that we're damned by blacker things than ourselves; and that the\ndamned are those who admit they're of the damned. Inertia and hypnosis\nare too strong for us. We say that: then we go right on admitting we're\nof the damned. It is only by being more nearly real that we can sweep\naway the quasi-things that oppose us. Of course, as a whole, we have\nconsiderable amorphousness, but we are thinking now of \"individual\"\nacceptances. Wideness is an aspect of Universalness or Realness. If our\nsyntheses disregard fewer data than do opposing syntheses--which are\noften not syntheses at all, but mere consideration of some one\ncircumstance--less widely synthetic things fade away before us. Harmony\nis an aspect of the Universal, by which we mean Realness.

We pile them up, and we\npile them up, or they pass and pass and pass: things that bulk large as\nthey march by, supporting and solidifying one another--\n\nAnd still, and for regiments to come, hypnosis and inertia rule us--\n\nOne of the damnedest of our data:\n\nIn the _Scientific American_, Sept. 10, 1910, Charles F. Holder writes:\n\n\"Many years ago, a strange stone resembling a meteorite, fell into the\nValley of the Yaqui, Mexico, and the sensational story went from one end\nto the other of the country that a stone bearing human inscriptions had\ndescended to the earth.\"\n\nThe bewildering observation here is Mr. Holder's assertion that this\nstone did fall. It seems to me that he must mean that it fell by\ndislodgment from a mountainside into a valley--but we shall see that it\nwas such a marked stone that very unlikely would it have been unknown to\ndwellers in a valley, if it had been reposing upon a mountainside above\nthem. It may have been carelessness: intent may have been to say that a\nsensational story of a strange stone said to have fallen, etc. This stone was reported by Major Frederick Burnham, of the British Army. Later Major Burnham revisited it, and Mr. Holder accompanied him, their\npurpose to decipher the inscriptions upon it, if possible. \"This stone was a brown, igneous rock, its longest axis about eight\nfeet, and on the eastern face, which had an angle of about forty-five\ndegrees, was the deep-cut inscription.\"\n\nMr. Holder says that he recognized familiar Mayan symbols in the\ninscription. His method was the usual method by which anything can be\n\"identified\" as anything else: that is to pick out whatever is agreeable\nand disregard the rest. He says that he has demonstrated that most of\nthe symbols are Mayan. One of our intermediatist pseudo-principles is\nthat any way of demonstrating anything is just as good a way of\ndemonstrating anything else. By Mr. Holder's method we could demonstrate\nthat we're Mayan--if that should be a source of pride to us. One of the\ncharacters upon this stone is a circle within a circle--similar\ncharacter found by Mr. Holder is a Mayan manuscript. There are two 6's. 6's can be found in Mayan manuscripts. A double scroll. There are dots\nand there are dashes. Well, then, we, in turn, disregard the circle\nwithin a circle and the double scroll and emphasize that 6's occur in\nthis book, and that dots are plentiful, and would be more plentiful if\nit were customary to use the small \"i\" for the first personal\npronoun--that when it comes to dashes--that's demonstrated: we're Mayan. I suppose the tendency is to feel that we're sneering at some valuable\narchaeologic work, and that Mr. Holder did make a veritable\nidentification. He writes:\n\n\"I submitted the photographs to the Field Museum and the Smithsonian and\none or two others, and, to my surprise, the reply was that they could\nmake nothing out of it.\"\n\nOur indefinite acceptance, by preponderance of three or four groups of\nmuseum-experts against one person, is that a stone bearing inscriptions\nunassimilable with any known language upon this earth, is said to have\nfallen from the sky. Another poor wretch of an outcast belonging here is\nnoted in the _Scientific American_, 48-261: that, of an object, or a\nmeteorite, that fell Feb. 16, 1883, near Brescia, Italy, a false report\nwas circulated that one of the fragments bore the impress of a hand. That's all that is findable by me upon this mere gasp of a thing. Intermediatistically, my acceptance is that, though in the course of\nhuman history, there have been some notable approximations, there never\nhas been a real liar: that he could not survive in intermediateness,\nwhere everything merges away or has its pseudo-base in something\nelse--would be instantly translated to the Negative Absolute. So my\nacceptance is that, though curtly dismissed, there was something to base\nupon in this report; that there were unusual markings upon this object. Of course that is not to jump to the conclusion that they were cuneiform\ncharacters that looked like finger-prints. Altogether, I think that in some of our past expressions, we must have\nbeen very efficient, if the experience of Mr. Symons be typical, so\nindefinite are we becoming here. Just here we are interested in many\nthings that have been found, especially in the United States, which\nspeak of a civilization, or of many civilizations not indigenous to\nthis earth. One trouble is in trying to decide whether they fell here\nfrom the sky, or were left behind by visitors from other worlds.",

One trouble is in trying to decide whether they fell here\nfrom the sky, or were left behind by visitors from other worlds. We have\na notion that there have been disasters aloft, and that coins have\ndropped here: that inhabitants of this earth found them or saw them\nfall, and then made coins imitatively: it may be that coins were\nshowered here by something of a tutelary nature that undertook to\nadvance us from the stage of barter to the use of a medium. If coins\nshould be identified as Roman coins, we've had so much experience with\n\"identifications\" that we know a phantom when we see one--but, even so,\nhow could Roman coins have got to North America--far in the interior of\nNorth America--or buried under the accumulation of centuries of\nsoil--unless they did drop from--wherever the first Romans came from? Ignatius Donnelly, in _Atlantis_, gives a list of objects that have been\nfound in mounds that are supposed to antedate all European influence in\nAmerica: lathe-made articles, such as traders--from somewhere--would\nsupply to savages--marks of the lathe said to be unmistakable. Said to\nbe: of course we can't accept that anything is unmistakable. In the\n_Rept. Smithson. Inst._, 1881-619, there is an account, by Charles C. Jones, of two silver crosses that were found in Georgia. They are\nskillfully made, highly ornamented crosses, but are not conventional\ncrucifixes: all arms of equal length. Mr. Jones is a good\npositivist--that De Sota had halted at the \"precise\" spot where these\ncrosses were found. But the spirit of negativeness that lurks in all\nthings said to be \"precise\" shows itself in that upon one of these\ncrosses is an inscription that has no meaning in Spanish or any other\nknown, terrestrial language:\n\n\"IYNKICIDU,\" according to Mr. Jones. He thinks that this is a name, and\nthat there is an aboriginal ring to it, though I should say, myself,\nthat he was thinking of the far-distant Incas: that the Spanish donor\ncut on the cross the name of an Indian to whom it was presented. But we\nlook at the inscription ourselves and see that the letters said to be\n\"C\" and \"D\" are turned the wrong way, and that the letter said to be \"K\"\nis not only turned the wrong way, but is upside down. It is difficult to accept that the remarkable, the very extensive,\ncopper mines in the region of Lake Superior were ever the works of\nAmerican aborigines. Despite the astonishing extent of these mines,\nnothing has ever been found to indicate that the region was ever\ninhabited by permanent dwellers-- \"... not a vestige of a dwelling, a\nskeleton, or a bone has been found.\" The Indians have no traditions\nrelating to the mines. (_Amer. Antiquarian_, 25-258.) I think that we've\nhad visitors: that they have come here for copper, for instance. As to\nother relics of them--but we now come upon frequency of a merger that\nhas not so often appeared before:\n\nFraudulency. Hair called real hair--then there are wigs. Teeth called real\nteeth--then there are false teeth. Official money--counterfeit money. It's the bane of psychic research. If there be psychic phenomena, there\nmust be fraudulent psychic phenomena. So desperate is the situation here\nthat Carrington argues that, even if Palladino be caught cheating, that\nis not to say that all her phenomena are fraudulent. My own version is:\nthat nothing indicates anything, in a positive sense, because, in a\npositive sense, there is nothing to be indicated. Everything that is\ncalled true must merge away indistinguishably into something called\nfalse. Both are expressions of the same underlying quasiness, and are\ncontinuous. Fraudulent antiquarian relics are very common, but they are\nnot more common than are fraudulent paintings. W.S. Forest, _Historical Sketches of Norfolk, Virginia_:\n\nThat, in September, 1833, when some workmen, near Norfolk, were boring\nfor water, a coin was drawn up from a depth of about 30 feet. It was\nabout the size of an English shilling, but oval--an oval disk, if not a\ncoin. The figures upon it were distinct, and represented \"a warrior or\nhunter and other characters, apparently of Roman origin.\"\n\nThe means of exclusion would probably be--men digging a hole--no one\nelse looking: one of them drops a coin into the hole--as to where he got\na strange coin, remarkable in shape even--that's disregarded. Up comes\nthe coin--expressions of astonishment from the evil one who had dropped\nit. However, the antiquarians have missed this coin. I can find no other\nmention of it. Another coin. Also a little study in the genesis of a prophet. In the _American Antiquarian_, 16-313, is copied a story by a\ncorrespondent to the _Detroit News_, of a copper coin about the size of\na two-cent piece, said to have been found in a Michigan mound. The\nEditor says merely that he does not endorse the find.",

The\nEditor says merely that he does not endorse the find. Upon this slender\nbasis, he buds out, in the next number of the _Antiquarian_:\n\n\"The coin turns out, as we predicted, to be a fraud.\"\n\nYou can imagine the scorn of Elijah, or any of the old more nearly real\nprophets. Or all things are tried by the only kind of jurisprudence we have in\nquasi-existence:\n\nPresumed to be innocent until convicted--but they're guilty. The Editor's reasoning is as phantom-like as my own, or St. Paul's, or\nDarwin's. The coin is condemned because it came from the same region\nfrom which, a few years before, had come pottery that had been called\nfraudulent. The pottery had been condemned because it was condemnable. _Scientific American_, about 1882:\n\nThat a farmer, in Cass Co., Ill., had picked up, on his farm, a bronze\ncoin, which was sent to Prof. F.F. Hilder, of St. Louis, who identified\nit as a coin of Antiochus IV. Inscription said to be in ancient Greek\ncharacters: translated as \"King Antiochus Epiphanes (Illustrious) the\nVictorius.\" Sounds quite definite and convincing--but we have some more\ntranslations coming. In the _American Pioneer_, 2-169, are shown two faces of a copper coin,\nwith characters very much like those upon the Grave Creek stone--which,\nwith translations, we'll take up soon. This coin is said to have been\nfound in Connecticut, in 1843. _Records of the Past_, 12-182:\n\nThat, early in 1913, a coin, said to be a Roman coin, was reported as\ndiscovered in an Illinois mound. It was sent to Dr. Emerson, of the Art\nInstitute, of Chicago. His opinion was that the coin is \"of the rare\nmintage of Domitius Domitianus, Emperor in Egypt.\" As to its discovery\nin an Illinois mound, Dr. Emerson disclaims responsibility. But what\nstrikes me here is that a joker should not have been satisfied with an\nordinary Roman coin. Where did he get a rare coin, and why was it not\nmissed from some collection? I have looked over numismatic journals\nenough to accept that the whereabouts of every rare coin in anyone's\npossession is known to coin-collectors. Seems to me nothing left but to\ncall this another \"identification.\"\n\n_Proc. Amer. Phil. Soc._, 12-224:\n\nThat, in July, 1871, a letter was received from Mr. Jacob W. Moffit, of\nChillicothe, Ill., enclosing a photograph of a coin, which he said had\nbeen brought up, by him, while boring, from a depth of 120 feet. Of course, by conventional scientific standards, such depth has some\nextraordinary meaning. Palaeontologists, geologists, and archaeologists\nconsider themselves reasonable in arguing ancient origin of the\nfar-buried. We only accept: depth is a pseudo-standard with us; one\nearthquake could bury a coin of recent mintage 120 feet below the\nsurface. According to a writer in the _Proceedings_, the coin is uniform in\nthickness, and had never been hammered out by savages--\"there are other\ntokens of the machine shop.\"\n\nBut, according to Prof. Leslie, it is an astrologic amulet. \"There are\nupon it the signs of Pisces and Leo.\"\n\nOr, with due disregard, you can find signs of your great-grand-mother,\nor of the Crusades, or of the Mayans, upon anything that ever came from\nChillicothe or from a five and ten cent store. Anything that looks like\na cat and a goldfish looks like Leo and Pisces: but, by due suppressions\nand distortions there's nothing that can't be made to look like a cat\nand a goldfish. I fear me we're turning a little irritable here. To be\ndamned by slumbering giants and interesting little harlots and clowns\nwho rank high in their profession is at least supportable to our vanity;\nbut, we find that the anthropologists are of the slums of the divine, or\nof an archaic kindergarten of intellectuality, and it is very\nunflattering to find a mess of moldy infants sitting in judgment upon\nus. Prof. Leslie then finds, as arbitrarily as one might find that some\njoker put the Brooklyn Bridge where it is, that \"the piece was placed\nthere as a practical joke, though not by its present owner; and is a\nmodern fabrication, perhaps of the sixteenth century, possibly\nHispano-American or French-American origin.\"\n\nIt's sheer, brutal attempt to assimilate a thing that may or may not\nhave fallen from the sky, with phenomena admitted by the anthropologic\nsystem: or with the early French or Spanish explorers of Illinois. Though it is ridiculous in a positive sense to give reasons, it is more\nacceptable to attempt reasons more nearly real than opposing reasons. Of\ncourse, in his favor, we note that Prof. Leslie qualifies his notions. But his disregards are that there is nothing either French or Spanish\nabout this coin. A legend upon it is said to be \"somewhere between\nArabic and Phoenician, without being either.\" Prof. Winchell (_Sparks\nfrom a Geologist's Hammer_, p.",

Conventionally, or, with no\nreal reason for so doing, we exclude these things, and then, as grossly\nand arbitrarily and irrationally--though our attempt is always to\napproximate away from these negative states--as ever a Kepler, Newton,\nor Darwin made his selections, without which he could not have seemed\nto be, at all, because every one of them is now seen to be an illusion,\nwe accept that other lettered things have been found in mounds in the\nUnited States. Of course we do what we can to make the selection seem\nnot gross and arbitrary and irrational. Then, if we accept that\ninscribed things of ancient origin have been found in the United States;\nthat cannot be attributed to any race indigenous to the western\nhemisphere; that are not in any language ever heard of in the eastern\nhemisphere--there's nothing to it but to turn non-Euclidian and try to\nconceive of a third \"hemisphere,\" or to accept that there has been\nintercourse between the western hemisphere and some other world. But there is a peculiarity to these inscribed objects. They remind me of\nthe records left, by Sir John Franklin, in the Arctic; but, also, of\nattempts made by relief expeditions to communicate with the Franklin\nexpedition. The lost explorers cached their records--or concealed them\nconspicuously in mounds. The relief expeditions sent up balloons, from\nwhich messages were dropped broadcast. Our data are of things that have\nbeen cached, and of things that seem to have been dropped--\n\nOr a Lost Expedition from--Somewhere. Explorers from somewhere, and their inability to return--then, a long,\nsentimental, persistent attempt, in the spirit of our own Arctic\nrelief-expeditions--at least to establish communication--\n\nWhat if it may have succeeded? We think of India--the millions of natives who are ruled by a small band\nof esoterics--only because they receive support and direction\nfrom--somewhere else--or from England. In 1838, Mr. A.B. Tomlinson, owner of the great mound at Grave Creek,\nWest Virginia, excavated the mound. He said that, in the presence of\nwitnesses, he had found a small, flat, oval stone--or disk--upon which\nwere engraved alphabetic characters. Col. Whittelsey, an expert in these matters, says that the stone is now\n\"universally regarded by archaeologists as a fraud\": that, in his\nopinion, Mr. Tomlinson had been imposed upon. Avebury, _Prehistoric Times_, p. 271:\n\n\"I mention it because it has been the subject of much discussion, but\nit is now generally admitted to be a fraud. It is inscribed with Hebrew\ncharacters, but the forger has copied the modern instead of the ancient\nform of the letters.\"\n\nAs I have said, we're as irritable here, under the oppressions of the\nanthropologists as ever were slaves in the south toward superiorities\nfrom \"poor white trash.\" When we finally reverse our relative positions\nwe shall give lowest place to the anthropologists. A Dr. Gray does at\nleast look at a fish before he conceives of a miraculous origin for it. We shall have to submerge Lord Avebury far below him--if we accept that\nthe stone from Grave Creek is generally regarded as a fraud by eminent\nauthorities who did not know it from some other object--or, in general,\nthat so decided an opinion must be the product of either deliberate\ndisregard or ignorance or fatigue. The stone belongs to a class of\nphenomena that is repulsive to the System. It will not assimilate with\nthe System. Let such an object be heard of by such a systematist as\nAvebury, and the mere mention of it is as nearly certainly the stimulus\nto a conventional reaction as is a charged body to an electroscope or a\nglass of beer to a prohibitionist. It is of the ideals of Science to\nknow one object from another before expressing an opinion upon a thing,\nbut that is not the spirit of universal mechanics:\n\nA thing. It is attractive or repulsive.",

Let such an object be heard of by such a systematist as\nAvebury, and the mere mention of it is as nearly certainly the stimulus\nto a conventional reaction as is a charged body to an electroscope or a\nglass of beer to a prohibitionist. It is of the ideals of Science to\nknow one object from another before expressing an opinion upon a thing,\nbut that is not the spirit of universal mechanics:\n\nA thing. It is attractive or repulsive. Its conventional reaction\nfollows. Because it is not the stone from Grave Creek that is in Hebrew\ncharacters, either ancient or modern: it is a stone from Newark, Ohio,\nof which the story is told that a forger made this mistake of using\nmodern instead of ancient Hebrew characters. We shall see that the\ninscription upon the Grave Creek stone is not in Hebrew. Or all things are presumed to be innocent, but are supposed to be\nguilty--unless they assimilate. Col. Whittelsey (_Western Reserve Historical Tracts, No. 33_) says that\nthe Grave Creek stone was considered a fraud by Wilson, Squires, and\nDavis. Then he comes to the Congress of Archaeologists at Nancy, France,\n1875. It is hard for Col. Whittelsey to admit that, at this meeting,\nwhich sounds important, the stone was endorsed. He reminds us of Mr. Symons, and \"the man\" who \"considered\" that he saw something. Col. Whittelsey's somewhat tortuous expression is that the finder of the\nstone \"so imposed his views\" upon the congress that it pronounced the\nstone genuine. Also the stone was examined by Schoolcraft. He gave his opinion for\ngenuineness. Or there's only one process, and \"see-saw\" is one of its aspects. Three\nor four fat experts on the side against us. We find four or five plump\nones on our side. Or all that we call logic and reasoning ends up as\nsheer preponderance of avoirdupois. Then several philologists came out in favor of genuineness. Some of them\ntranslated the inscription. Of course, as we have said, it is our\nmethod--or the method of orthodoxy--way in which all conclusions are\nreached--to have some awfully eminent, or preponderantly plump,\nauthorities with us whenever we can--in this case, however, we feel just\na little apprehensive in being caught in such excellently obese, but\nsomewhat negativized, company:\n\nTranslation by M. Jombard:\n\n\"Thy orders are laws: thou shinest in impetuous \u00e9lan and rapid chamois.\"\n\nM. Maurice Schwab:\n\n\"The chief of Emigration who reached these places (or this island) has\nfixed these characters forever.\"\n\nM. Oppert:\n\n\"The grave of one who was assassinated here. May God, to revenge him,\nstrike his murderer, cutting off the hand of his existence.\"\n\nI like the first one best. I have such a vivid impression from it of\nsomeone polishing up brass or something, and in an awful hurry. Of\ncourse the third is more dramatic--still they're all very good. They are\nperturbations of one another, I suppose. In Tract 44, Col. Whittelsey returns to the subject. He gives the\nconclusion of Major De Helward, at the Congress of Luxembourg, 1877:\n\n\"If Prof. Read and myself are right in the conclusion that the figures\nare neither of the Runic, Phoenician, Canaanite, Hebrew, Lybian,\nCeltic, or any other alphabet-language, its importance has been greatly\nover-rated.\"\n\nObvious to a child; obvious to any mentality not helplessly subjected to\na system:\n\nThat just therein lies the importance of this object. It is said that an ideal of science is to find out the new--but, unless\na thing be of the old, it is \"unimportant.\"\n\n\"It is not worth while.\" (Hovey.)\n\nThen the inscribed ax, or wedge, which, according to Dr. John C. Evans,\nin a communication to the American Ethnological Society, was plowed up,\nnear Pemberton, N.J., 1859. The characters upon this ax, or wedge, are\nstrikingly similar to the characters on the Grave Creek stone. Also,\nwith a little disregard here and a little more there, they look like\ntracks in the snow by someone who's been out celebrating, or like your\nhandwriting, or mine, when we think there's a certain distinction in\nillegibility. Method of disregard: anything's anything. Dr. Abbott describes this object in the _Report of the Smithsonian\nInstitution_, 1875-260. He says he has no faith in it. All progress is from the outrageous to the commonplace. Or\nquasi-existence proceeds from rape to the crooning of lullabies. It's\nbeen interesting to me to go over various long-established periodicals\nand note controversies between attempting positivists and then\nintermediatistic issues. Bold, bad intruders of theories; ruffians with\ndishonorable intentions--the alarms of Science; her attempts to preserve\nthat which is dearer than life itself--submission--then a fidelity like\nMrs. Micawber's. So many of these ruffians, or wandering comedians that\nwere hated, or scorned, pitied, embraced, conventionalized. There's not\na notion in this book that has a more frightful, or ridiculous, mien\nthan had the notion of human footprints in rocks, when that now\nrespectabilized ruffian, or clown, was first heard from. It seems\nbewildering to one whose interests are not scientific that such rows\nshould be raised over such trifles: but the feeling of a systematist\ntoward such an intruder is just about what anyone's would be if a tramp\nfrom the street should come in, sit at one's dinner table, and say he\nbelonged there.",

We know what hypnosis can do: let him insist with all\nhis might that he does belong there, and one begins to suspect that he\nmay be right; that he may have higher perceptions of what's right. The\nprohibitionists had this worked out very skillfully. So the row that was raised over the stone from Grave Creek--but time and\ncumulativeness, and the very factor we make so much of--or the power of\nmassed data. There were other reports of inscribed stones, and then,\nhalf a century later, some mounds--or caches, as we call them--were\nopened by the Rev. Mr. Gass, near the city of Davenport. (_American\nAntiquarian_, 15-73.) Several stone tablets were found. Upon one of\nthem, the letters \"TFTOWNS\" may easily be made out. In this instance we\nhear nothing of fraudulency--time, cumulativeness, the power of massed\ndata. The attempt to assimilate this datum is:\n\nThat the tablet was probably of Mormon origin. Why? Because, at Mendon, Ill., was found a brass plate, upon which were\nsimilar characters. Why that? Because that was found \"near a house once occupied by a Mormon.\"\n\nIn a real existence, a real meteorologist, suspecting that cinders had\ncome from a fire engine--would have asked a fireman. Tablets of Davenport--there's not a record findable that it ever\noccurred to any antiquarian--to ask a Mormon. Other tablets were found. Upon one of them are two \"F's\" and two \"8's.\"\nAlso a large tablet, twelve inches by eight to ten inches \"with Roman\nnumerals and Arabic.\" It is said that the figure \"8\" occurs three times,\nand the figure or letter \"O\" seven times. \"With these familiar\ncharacters are others that resemble ancient alphabets, either\nPhoenecian or Hebrew.\"\n\nIt may be that the discovery of Australia, for instance, will turn out\nto be less important than the discovery and the meaning of these\ntablets--\n\nBut where will you read of them in anything subsequently published; what\nantiquarian has ever since tried to understand them, and their presence,\nand indications of antiquity, in a land that we're told was inhabited\nonly by unlettered savages? These things that are exhumed only to be buried in some other way. Another tablet was found, at Davenport, by Mr. Charles Harrison,\npresident of the American Antiquarian Society. \"... 8 and other\nhieroglyphics are upon this tablet.\" This time, also, fraud is not\nmentioned. My own notion is that it is very unsportsmanlike ever to\nmention fraud. Accept anything. Then explain it your way. Anything that\nassimilates with one explanation, must have assimilable relations, to\nsome degree, with all other explanations, if all explanations are\nsomewhere continuous. Mormons are lugged in again, but the attempt is\nfaint and helpless--\"because general circumstances make it difficult to\nexplain the presence of these tablets.\"\n\nAltogether our phantom resistance is mere attribution to the Mormons,\nwithout the slightest attempt to find base for the attribution. We think\nof messages that were showered upon this earth, and of messages that\nwere cached in mounds upon this earth. The similarity to the Franklin\nsituation is striking. Conceivably centuries from now, objects dropped\nfrom relief-expedition-balloons may be found in the Arctic, and\nconceivably there are still undiscovered caches left by Franklin, in the\nhope that relief expeditions would find them. It would be as incongruous\nto attribute these things to the Eskimos as to attribute tablets and\nlettered stones to the aborigines of America. Some time I shall take up\nan expression that the queer-shaped mounds upon this earth were built by\nexplorers from Somewhere, unable to get back, designed to attract\nattention from some other world, and that a vast sword-shaped mound has\nbeen discovered upon the moon--Just now we think of lettered things and\ntheir two possible significances. A bizarre little lost soul, rescued from one of the morgues of the\n_American Journal of Science_:\n\nAn account, sent by a correspondent, to Prof. Silliman, of something\nthat was found in a block of marble, taken November, 1829, from a\nquarry, near Philadelphia (_Am. J. Sci._, 1-19-361). The block was cut\ninto slabs. By this process, it is said, was exposed an indentation in\nthe stone, about one and a half inches by five-eighths of an inch. A\ngeometric indentation: in it were two definite-looking raised letters,\nlike \"I U\": only difference is that the corners of the \"U\" are not\nrounded, but are right angles. We are told that this block of stone came\nfrom a depth of seventy or eighty feet--or that, if acceptable, this\nlettering was done long, long ago.",

To some persons, not sated with the\ncommonness of the incredible that has to be accepted, it may seem\ngrotesque to think that an indentation in sand could have tons of other\nsand piled upon it and hardening into stone, without being pressed\nout--but the famous Nicaraguan footprints were found in a quarry under\neleven strata of solid rock. There was no discussion of this datum. We\nonly take it out for an airing. As to lettered stones that may once upon a time have been showered upon\nEurope, if we cannot accept that the stones were inscribed by indigenous\ninhabitants of Europe, many have been found in caves--whence they were\ncarried as curiosities by prehistoric men, or as ornaments, I suppose. About the size and shape of the Grave Creek stone, or disk: \"flat and\noval and about two inches wide.\" (Sollas.) Characters painted upon them:\nfound first by M. Piette, in the cave of Mas d'Azil, Ari\u00e9ge. According\nto Sollas, they are marked in various directions with red and black\nlines. \"But on not a few of them, more complex characters occur, which\nin a few instances simulate some of the capital letters of the Roman\nalphabet.\" In one instance the letters \"F E I\" accompanied by no other\nmarkings to modify them, are as plain as they could be. According to\nSollas (_Ancient Hunters_, p. 95) M. Cartailhac has confirmed the\nobservations of Piette, and M. Boule has found additional examples. \"They offer one of the darkest problems of prehistoric times.\" (Sollas.)\n\nAs to caches in general, I should say that they are made with two\npurposes: to proclaim and to conceal; or that caches documents are\nhidden, or covered over, in conspicuous structures; at least, so are\ndesigned the cairns in the Arctic. _Trans. N.Y. Acad. of Sciences_, 11-27:\n\nThat Mr. J.H. Hooper, Bradley Co., Tenn., having come upon a curious\nstone, in some woods upon his farm, investigated. He dug. He unearthed a\nlong wall. Upon this wall were inscribed many alphabetic characters. \"872 characters have been examined, many of them duplicates, and a few\nimitations of animal forms, the moon, and other objects. Accidental\nimitations of oriental alphabets are numerous.\"\n\nThe part that seems significant:\n\nThat these letters had been hidden under a layer of cement. And still, in our own heterogeneity, or unwillingness, or inability, to\nconcentrate upon single concepts, we shall--or we sha'n't--accept that,\nthough there may have been a Lost Colony or Lost Expedition from\nSomewhere, upon this earth, and extra-mundane visitors who could never\nget back, there have been other extra-mundane visitors, who have gone\naway again--altogether quite in analogy with the Franklin Expedition and\nPeary's flittings in the Arctic--\n\nAnd a wreck that occurred to one group of them--\n\nAnd the loot that was lost overboard--\n\nThe Chinese seals of Ireland. Not the things with the big, wistful eyes that lie on ice, and that are\ntaught to balance objects on their noses--but inscribed stamps, with\nwhich to make impressions. _Proc. Roy. Irish Acad._, 1-381:\n\nA paper was read by Mr. J. Huband Smith, descriptive of about a dozen\nChinese seals that had been found in Ireland. They are all alike: each a\ncube with an animal seated upon it. \"It is said that the inscriptions\nupon them are of a very ancient class of Chinese characters.\"\n\nThe three points that have made a leper and an outcast of this\ndatum--but only in the sense of disregard, because nowhere that I know\nof is it questioned:\n\nAgreement among archaeologists that there were no relations, in the\nremote past, between China and Ireland:\n\nThat no other objects, from ancient China--virtually, I suppose--have\never been found in Ireland:\n\nThe great distances at which these seals have been found apart. After Mr. Smith's investigations--if he did investigate, or do more than\nrecord--many more Chinese seals were found in Ireland, and, with one\nexception, only in Ireland. In 1852, about 60 had been found. Of all\narchaeologic finds in Ireland, \"none is enveloped in greater mystery.\"\n(_Chambers' Journal_, 16-364.) According to the writer in _Chambers'\nJournal_, one of these seals was found in a curiosity shop in London. When questioned, the shopkeeper said that it had come from Ireland. In this instance, if you don't take instinctively to our expression,\nthere is no orthodox explanation for your preference. It is the\nastonishing scattering of them, over field and forest, that has hushed\nthe explainers. In the _Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy_, 10-171,\nDr. Frazer says that they \"appear to have been sown broadcast over the\ncountry in some strange way that I cannot offer solution of.\"\n\nThe struggle for expression of a notion that did not belong to Dr.",

But one of these Chinese seals was found in the bed of the River Boyne,\nnear Clonard, Meath, when workmen were raising gravel. That one, at least, had been dropped there. Astronomy. And a watchman looking at half a dozen lanterns, where a street's been\ntorn up. There are gas lights and kerosene lamps and electric lights in the\nneighborhood: matches flaring, fires in stoves, bonfires, house afire\nsomewhere; lights of automobiles, illuminated signs--\n\nThe watchman and his one little system. Ethics. And some young ladies and the dear old professor of a very \"select\"\nseminary. Drugs and divorce and rape: venereal diseases, drunkenness, murder--\n\nExcluded. The prim and the precise, or the exact, the homogeneous, the single, the\npuritanic, the mathematic, the pure, the perfect. We can have illusion\nof this state--but only by disregarding its infinite denials. It's a\ndrop of milk afloat in acid that's eating it. The positive swamped by\nthe negative. So it is in intermediateness, where only to \"be\" positive\nis to generate corresponding and, perhaps, equal negativeness. In our\nacceptance, it is, in quasi-existence, premonitory, or pre-natal, or\npre-awakening consciousness of a real existence. But this consciousness of realness is the greatest resistance to efforts\nto realize or to become real--because it is feeling that realness has\nbeen attained. Our antagonism is not to Science, but to the attitude of\nthe sciences that they have finally realized; or to belief, instead of\nacceptance; to the insufficiency, which, as we have seen over and over,\namounts to paltriness and puerility of scientific dogmas and standards. Or, if several persons start out to Chicago, and get to Buffalo, and one\nbe under the delusion that Buffalo is Chicago, that one will be a\nresistance to the progress of the others. So astronomy and its seemingly exact, little system--\n\nBut data we shall have of round worlds and spindle-shaped worlds, and\nworlds shaped like a wheel; worlds like titanic pruning hooks; worlds\nlinked together by streaming filaments; solitary worlds, and worlds in\nhordes: tremendous worlds and tiny worlds: some of them made of material\nlike the material of this earth; and worlds that are geometric\nsuper-constructions made of iron and steel--\n\nOr not only fall from the sky of ashes and cinders and coke and charcoal\nand oily substances that suggest fuel--but the masses of iron that have\nfallen upon this earth. Wrecks and flotsam and fragments of vast iron constructions--\n\nOr steel. Sooner or later we shall have to take up an expression that\nfragments of steel have fallen from the sky. If fragments not of iron,\nbut of steel have fallen upon this earth--\n\nBut what would a deep-sea fish learn even if a steel plate of a wrecked\nvessel above him should drop and bump him on the nose? Our submergence in a sea of conventionality of almost impenetrable\ndensity. Sometimes I'm a savage who has found something on the beach of his\nisland. Sometimes I'm a deep-sea fish with a sore nose. The greatest of mysteries:\n\nWhy don't they ever come here, or send here, openly? Of course there's nothing to that mystery if we don't take so seriously\nthe notion--that we must be interesting. It's probably for moral reasons\nthat they stay away--but even so, there must be some degraded ones among\nthem. Or physical reasons:\n\nWhen we can specially take up that subject, one of our leading ideas, or\ncredulities, will be that near approach by another world to this world\nwould be catastrophic: that navigable worlds would avoid proximity; that\nothers that have survived have organized into protective remotenesses,\nor orbits which approximate to regularity, though by no means to the\ndegree of popular supposition. But the persistence of the notion that we must be interesting. Bugs and\ngerms and things like that: they're interesting to us: some of them are\ntoo interesting. Dangers of near approach--nevertheless our own ships that dare not\nventure close to a rocky shore can send rowboats ashore--\n\nWhy not diplomatic relations established between the United States and\nCyclorea--which, in our advanced astronomy, is the name of a remarkable\nwheel-shaped world or super-construction? Why not missionaries sent here\nopenly to convert us from our barbarous prohibitions and other taboos,\nand to prepare the way for a good trade in ultra-bibles and\nsuper-whiskeys; fortunes made in selling us cast-off super-fineries,\nwhich we'd take to like an African chief to someone's old silk hat from\nNew York or London?",

The answer that occurs to me is so simple that it seems immediately\nacceptable, if we accept that the obvious is the solution of all\nproblems, or if most of our perplexities consist in laboriously and\npainfully conceiving of the unanswerable, and then looking for\nanswers--using such words as \"obvious\" and \"solution\" conventionally--\n\nOr:\n\nWould we, if we could, educate and sophisticate pigs, geese, cattle? Would it be wise to establish diplomatic relation with the hen that now\nfunctions, satisfied with mere sense of achievement by way of\ncompensation? I think we're property.

But as to surreptitious visits to this earth, in recent times, or\nas to emissaries, perhaps, from other worlds, or voyagers who have shown\nevery indication of intent to evade and avoid, we shall have data as\nconvincing as our data of oil or coal-burning aerial super-constructions. But, in this vast subject, I shall have to do considerable neglecting or\ndisregarding, myself. I don't see how I can, in this book, take up at\nall the subject of possible use of humanity to some other mode of\nexistence, or the flattering notion that we can possibly be worth\nsomething. Pigs, geese, and cattle. First find out that they are owned. Then find out the whyness of it. I suspect that, after all, we're useful--that among contesting\nclaimants, adjustment has occurred, or that something now has a legal\nright to us, by force, or by having paid out analogues of beads for us\nto former, more primitive, owners of us--all others warned off--that all\nthis has been known, perhaps for ages, to certain ones upon this earth,\na cult or order, members of which function like bellwethers to the rest\nof us, or as superior slaves or overseers, directing us in accordance\nwith instructions received--from Somewhere else--in our mysterious\nusefulness. But I accept that, in the past, before proprietorship was established,\ninhabitants of a host of other worlds have--dropped here, hopped here,\nwafted, sailed, flown, motored--walked here, for all I know--been pulled\nhere, been pushed; have come singly, have come in enormous numbers; have\nvisited occasionally, have visited periodically for hunting, trading,\nreplenishing harems, mining: have been unable to stay here, have\nestablished colonies here, have been lost here; far-advanced peoples, or\nthings, and primitive peoples or whatever they were: white ones, black\nones, yellow ones--\n\nI have a very convincing datum that the ancient Britons were blue ones. Of course we are told by conventional anthropologists that they only\npainted themselves blue, but in our own advanced anthropology, they were\nveritable blue ones--\n\n_Annals of Philosophy_, 14-51:\n\nNote of a blue child born in England. That's atavism. Giants and fairies. We accept them, of course. Or, if we pride ourselves\nupon being awfully far-advanced, I don't know how to sustain our conceit\nexcept by very largely going far back. Science of today--the\nsuperstition of tomorrow.

The reasoning of this\nrepresentative phantom of the chosen, or of the spectral appearances who\nsit in judgment, or condemnation, upon us of the more nearly real:\n\nThat there never were giants upon this earth, because gigantic\nfootprints are more gigantic than prints made by men who are not giants. We think of giants as occasional visitors to this earth. Of\ncourse--Stonehenge, for instance. It may be that, as time goes on, we\nshall have to admit that there are remains of many tremendous\nhabitations of giants upon this earth, and that their appearances here\nwere more than casual--but their bones--or the absence of their bones--\n\nExcept--that, no matter how cheerful and unsuspicious my disposition may\nbe, when I go to the American Museum of Natural History, dark cynicisms\narise the moment I come to the fossils--or old bones that have been\nfound upon this earth--gigantic things--that have been reconstructed\ninto terrifying but \"proper\" dinosaurs--but my uncheerfulness--\n\nThe dodo did it. On one of the floors below the fossils, they have a reconstructed dodo. It's frankly a fiction: it's labeled as such--but it's been\nreconstructed so cleverly and so convincingly--\n\nFairies. \"Fairy crosses.\"\n\n_Harper's Weekly_, 50-715:\n\nThat, near the point where the Blue Ridge and the Allegheny Mountains\nunite, north of Patrick County, Virginia, many little stone crosses have\nbeen found. A race of tiny beings. They crucified cockroaches. Exquisite beings--but the cruelty of the exquisite. In their diminutive\nway they were human beings. They crucified. The \"fairy crosses,\" we are told in _Harper's Weekly_, range in weight\nfrom one-quarter of an ounce to an ounce: but it is said, in the\n_Scientific American_, 79-395, that some of them are no larger than the\nhead of a pin. They have been found in two other states, but all in Virginia are\nstrictly localized on and along Bull Mountain. We are reminded of the Chinese seals in Ireland. I suppose they fell there. Some are Roman crosses, some St. Andrew's, some Maltese. This time we\nare spared contact with the anthropologists and have geologists instead,\nbut I am afraid that the relief to our finer, or more nearly real,\nsensibilities will not be very great. The geologists were called upon to\nexplain the \"fairy crosses.\" Their response was the usual scientific\ntropism--\"Geologists say that they are crystals.\" The writer in\n_Harper's Weekly_ points out that this \"hold up,\" or this an\u00e6sthetic, if\ntheoretic science be little but attempt to assuage pangs of the\nunexplained, fails to account for the localized distributions of these\nobjects--which make me think of both aggregation and separation at the\nbottom of the sea, if from a wrecked ship, similar objects should fall\nin large numbers but at different times. But some are Roman crosses, some St. Andrew's, some Maltese. Conceivably there might be a mineral that would have a diversity of\ngeometric forms, at the same time restricted to some expression of the\ncross, because snowflakes, for instance, have diversity but restriction\nto the hexagon, but the guilty geologists, cold-blooded as astronomers\nand chemists and all the other deep-sea fishes--though less profoundly\nof the pseudo-saved than the wretched anthropologists--disregarded the\nvery datum--that it was wise to disregard:\n\nThat the \"fairy crosses\" are not all made of the same material. It's the same old disregard, or it's the same old psycho-tropism, or\nprocess of assimilation. Crystals are geometric forms. Crystals are\nincluded in the System. So then \"fairy crosses\" are crystals. But that\ndifferent minerals should, in a few different regions, be inspired to\nturn into different forms of the cross--is the kind of resistance that\nwe call less nearly real than our own acceptances. We now come to some \"cursed\" little things that are of the \"lost,\" but\nfor the \"salvation\" of which scientific missionaries have done their\ndamnedest. \"Pigmy flints.\"\n\nThey can't very well be denied. They're lost and well known. \"Pigmy flints\" are tiny, prehistoric implements. Some of them are a\nquarter of an inch in size. England, India, France, South\nAfrica--they've been found in many parts of the world--whether showered\nthere or not. They belong high up in the froth of the accursed: they are\nnot denied, and they have not been disregarded; there is an abundant\nliterature upon this subject. One attempt to rationalize them, or\nassimilate them, or take them into the scientific fold, has been the\nnotion that they were toys of prehistoric children. It sounds\nreasonable.",

One attempt to rationalize them, or\nassimilate them, or take them into the scientific fold, has been the\nnotion that they were toys of prehistoric children. It sounds\nreasonable. But, of course, by the reasonable we mean that for which the\nequally reasonable, but opposing, has not been found out--except that we\nmodify that by saying that, though nothing's finally reasonable, some\nphenomena have higher approximations to Reasonableness than have others. Against the notion of toys, the higher approximation is that where\n\"pygmy flints\" are found, all flints are pygmies--at least so in India,\nwhere, when larger implements have been found in the same place, there\nare separations by strata. (Wilson.)\n\nThe datum that, just at present, leads me to accept that these flints\nwere made by beings about the size of pickles, is a point brought out by\nProf. Wilson (_Rept. National Museum_, 1892-455):\n\nNot only that the flints are tiny but that the chipping upon them is\n\"minute.\"\n\nStruggle for expression, in the mind of a 19th-century-ite, of an idea\nthat did not belong to his era:\n\nIn _Science Gossip_, 1896-36, R.A. Galty says:\n\n\"So fine is the chipping that to see the workmanship a magnifying glass\nis necessary.\"\n\nI think that would be absolutely convincing, if there were\nanything--absolutely anything--either that tiny beings, from pickle to\ncucumber-stature, made these things, or that ordinary savages made them\nunder magnifying glasses. The idea that we are now going to develop, or perpetrate, is rather\nintensely of the accursed, or the advanced. It's a lost soul, I\nadmit--or boast--but it fits in. Or, as conventional as ever, our own\nmethod is the scientific method of assimilating. It assimilates, if we\nthink of the inhabitants of Elvera--\n\nBy the way, I forgot to tell the name of the giant's world:\n\nMonstrator. Spindle-shaped world--about 100,000 miles along its major axis--more\ndetails to be published later. But our coming inspiration fits in, if we think of the inhabitants of\nElvera as having only visited here: having, in hordes as dense as clouds\nof bats, come here, upon hunting excursions--for mice, I should say: for\nbees, very likely--or most likely of all, or inevitably, to convert the\nheathen here--horrified with anyone who would gorge himself with more\nthan a bean at a time; fearful for the souls of beings who would guzzle\nmore than a dewdrop at a time--hordes of tiny missionaries, determined\nthat right should prevail, determining right by their own minutenesses. They must have been missionaries. Only to be is motion to convert or assimilate something else. The idea now is that tiny creatures coming here from their own little\nworld, which may be Eros, though I call it Elvera, would flit from the\nexquisite to the enormous--gulp of a fair-sized terrestrial animal--half\na dozen of them gone and soon digested. One falls into a brook--torn\naway in a mighty torrent--\n\nOr never anything but conventional, we adopt from Darwin:\n\n\"The geological records are incomplete.\"\n\nTheir flints would survive, but, as to their fragile bodies--one might\nas well search for prehistoric frost-traceries. A little\nwhirlwind--Elverean carried away a hundred yards--body never found by\nhis companions. They'd mourn for the departed. Conventional emotion to\nhave: they'd mourn. There'd have to be a funeral: there's no getting\naway from funerals. So I adopt an explanation that I take from the\nanthropologists: burial in effigy. Perhaps the Elvereans would not come\nto this earth again until many years later--another distressing\noccurrence--one little mausoleum for all burials in effigy. London _Times_, in the middle of the decade of the 1830s:\n\nThat, early in July, 1836, some boys were searching for rabbits' burrows\nin the rocky formation, near Edinburgh, known as Arthur's Seat. In the\nside of a cliff, they came upon some thin sheets of slate, which they\npulled out. Little cave. Seventeen tiny coffins. Three or four inches long. In the coffins were miniature wooden figures. They were dressed\ndifferently both in style and material. There were two tiers of eight\ncoffins each, and a third tier begun, with one coffin. The extraordinary datum, which has especially made mystery here:\n\nThat the coffins had been deposited singly, in the little cave, and at\nintervals of many years. In the first tier, the coffins were quite\ndecayed, and the wrappings had moldered away. In the second tier, the\neffects of age had not advanced so far. And the top coffin was quite\nrecent-looking. In the _Proceedings of the Society of Antiquarians of Scotland_,\n3-12-460, there is a full account of this find. Three of the coffins and\nthree of the figures are pictured.

The inhabitants of Monstrator and Elvera were primitives, I think, at\nthe time of their occasional visits to this earth--though, of course, in\na quasi-existence, anything that we semi-phantoms call evidence of\nanything may be just as good evidence of anything else. Logicians and\ndetectives and jurymen and suspicious wives and members of the Royal\nAstronomic Society recognize this indeterminateness, but have the\ndelusion that in the method of agreement there is final, or real\nevidence. The method is good enough for an \"existence\" that is only\nsemi-real, but also it is the method of reasoning by which witches were\nburned, and by which ghosts have been feared. I'd not like to be so\nunadvanced as to deny witches and ghosts, but I do think that there\nnever have been witches and ghosts like those of popular supposition. But stories of them have been supported by astonishing fabrications of\ndetails and of different accounts in agreement. So, if a giant left impressions of his bare feet in the ground, that is\nnot to say that he was a primitive--bulk of culture out taking the\nKneipp cure. So, if Stonehenge is a large, but only roughly geometric\nconstruction, the inattention to details by its builders--signifies\nanything you please--ambitious dwarfs or giants--if giants, that they\nwere little more than cave men, or that they were post-impressionist\narchitects from a very far-advanced civilization. If there are other worlds, there are tutelary worlds--or that Kepler,\nfor instance, could not have been absolutely wrong: that his notion of\nan angel assigned to push along and guide each planet may not be very\nacceptable, but that, abstractedly, or in the notion of a tutelary\nrelation, we may find acceptance. Only to be is to be tutelary. Our general expression:\n\nThat \"everything\" in Intermediateness is not a thing, but is an endeavor\nto become something--by breaking away from its continuity, or merging\naway, with all other phenomena--is an attempt to break away from the\nvery essence of a relative existence and become absolute--if it have not\nsurrendered to, or become part of, some higher attempt:\n\nThat to this process there are two aspects:\n\nAttraction, or the spirit of everything to assimilate all other\nthings--if it have not given in and subordinated to--or have not been\nassimilated by--some higher attempted system, unity, organization,\nentity, harmony, equilibrium--\n\nAnd repulsion, or the attempt of everything to exclude or disregard the\nunassimilable. Universality of the process:\n\nAnything conceivable:\n\nA tree. It is doing all it can to assimilate substances of the soil and\nsubstances of the air, and sunshine, too, into tree-substance: obversely\nit is rejecting or excluding or disregarding that which it cannot\nassimilate. Cow grazing, pig rooting, tiger stalking: planets trying, or acting, to\ncapture comets; rag pickers and the Christian religion, and a cat down\nheadfirst in a garbage can; nations fighting for more territory,\nsciences correlating the data they can, trust magnates organizing,\nchorus girl out for a little late supper--all of them stopped somewhere\nby the unassimilable. Chorus girl and the broiled lobster. If she eats\nnot shell and all she represents universal failure to positivize. Also,\nif she does she represents universal failure to positivize: her ensuing\ndisorders will translate her to the Negative Absolute. Or Science and some of our cursed hard-shelled data. One speaks of the tutelarian as if it were something distinct in itself. So one speaks of a tree, a saint, a barrel of pork, the Rocky Mountains. One speaks of missionaries, as if they were positively different, or had\nidentity of their own, or were a species by themselves. To the\nIntermediatist, everything that seems to have identity is only attempted\nidentity, and every species is continuous with all other species, or\nthat which is called the specific is only emphasis upon some aspect of\nthe general. If there are cats, they're only emphasis upon universal\nfelinity. There is nothing that does not partake of that of which the\nmissionary, or the tutelary, is the special. Every conversation is a\nconflict of missionaries, each trying to convert the other, to\nassimilate, or to make the other similar to himself. If no progress be\nmade, mutual repulsion will follow.

Super-Israelimus--\n\nOr that, despite modern reasoning upon this subject, there was once\nsomething that was super-parental or tutelary to early orientals. Azuria, which was tutelary to the early Britons:\n\nAzuria, whence came the blue Britons, whose descendants gradually\ndiluting, like blueing in a wash-tub, where a faucet's turned on, have\nbeen most emphasized of sub-tutelarians, or assimilators ever since. Worlds that were once tutelarian worlds--before this earth became\nsole property of one of them--their attempts to convert or\nassimilate--but then the state that comes to all things in their\nmissionary-frustrations--unacceptance by all stomachs of some things;\nrejection by all societies of some units; glaciers that sort over and\ncast out stones--\n\nRepulsion. Wrath of the baffled missionary. There is no other wrath. All\nrepulsion is reaction to the unassimilable. So then the wrath of Azuria--\n\nBecause surrounding peoples of this earth would not assimilate with her\nown colonists in the part of the earth that we now call England. I don't know that there has ever been more nearly just, reasonable, or\nlogical wrath, in this earth's history--if there is no other wrath. The wrath of Azuria, because the other peoples of this earth would not\nturn blue to suit her. History is a department of human delusion that interests us. We are able\nto give a little advancement to history. In the vitrified forts of a few\nparts of Europe, we find data that the Humes and Gibbons have\ndisregarded. The vitrified forts surrounding England, but not in England. The vitrified forts of Scotland, Ireland, Brittany, and Bohemia. Or that, once upon a time, with electric blasts, Azuria tried to swipe\nthis earth clear of the peoples who resisted her. The vast blue bulk of Azuria appeared in the sky. Clouds turned green. The sun was formless and purple in the vibrations of wrath that were\nemanating from Azuria. The whitish, or yellowish, or brownish peoples of\nScotland, Ireland, Brittany, and Bohemia fled to hilltops and built\nforts. In a real existence, hilltops, or easiest accessibility to an\naerial enemy, would be the last choice in refuges. But here, in\nquasi-existence, if we're accustomed to run to hilltops, in times of\ndanger, we run to them just the same, even with danger closest to\nhilltops. Very common in quasi-existence: attempt to escape by running\ncloser to the pursuing. They built forts, or already had forts, on hilltops. Something poured electricity upon them. The stones of these forts exist to this day, vitrified, or melted and\nturned to glass. The archaeologists have jumped from one conclusion to another, like the\n\"rapid chamois\" we read of a while ago, to account for vitrified forts,\nalways restricted by the commandment that unless their conclusions\nconformed to such tenets as Exclusionism, of the System, they would be\nexcommunicated. So archaeologists, in their medieval dread of\nexcommunication, have tried to explain vitrified forts in terms of\nterrestrial experience. We find in their insufficiencies the same old\nassimilating of all that could be assimilated, and disregard for the\nunassimilable, conventionalizing into the explanation that vitrified\nforts were made by prehistoric peoples who built vast fires--often\nremote from wood-supply--to melt externally, and to cement together, the\nstones of their constructions. But negativeness always: so within itself\na science can never be homogeneous or unified or harmonious. So Miss\nRussel, in the _Journal of the B.A.A._, has pointed out that it is\nseldom that single stones, to say nothing of long walls, of large houses\nthat are burned to the ground, are vitrified. If we pay a little attention to this subject, ourselves, before starting\nto write upon it, which is one of the ways of being more nearly real\nthan oppositions so far encountered by us, we find:\n\nThat the stones of these forts are vitrified in no reference to\ncementing them: that they are cemented here and there, in streaks, as if\nspecial blasts had struck, or played, upon them. Then one thinks of lightning? Once upon a time something melted, in streaks, the stones of forts on\nthe tops of hills in Scotland, Ireland, Brittany, and Bohemia. Lightning selects the isolated and conspicuous. But some of the vitrified forts are not upon tops of hills: some are\nvery inconspicuous: their walls too are vitrified in streaks. Something once had effect, similar to lightning, upon forts, mostly on\nhills, in Scotland, Ireland, Brittany, and Bohemia. But upon hills, all over the rest of the world, are remains of forts\nthat are not vitrified. There is only one crime, in the local sense, and that is not to turn\nblue, if the gods are blue: but, in the universal sense, the one crime\nis not to turn the gods themselves green, if you're green.",

Poltergeists do not assimilate with our own present quasi-system, which\nis an attempt to correlate denied or disregarded data as phenomena of\nextra-telluric forces, expressed in physical terms. Therefore I regard\npoltergeists as evil or false or discordant or absurd--names that we\ngive to various degrees or aspects of the unassimilable, or that which\nresists attempts to organize, harmonize, systematize, or, in short, to\npositivize--names that we give to our recognitions of the negative\nstate. I don't care to deny poltergeists, because I suspect that later,\nwhen we're more enlightened, or when we widen the range of our\ncredulities, or take on more of that increase of ignorance that is\ncalled knowledge, poltergeists may become assimilable. Then they'll be\nas reasonable as trees. By reasonableness I mean that which assimilates\nwith a dominant force, or system, or a major body of thought--which is,\nitself, of course, hypnosis and delusion--developing, however, in our\nacceptance, to higher and higher approximations to realness. The\npoltergeists are now evil or absurd to me, proportionately to their\npresent unassimilableness, compounded, however, with the factor of their\npossible future assimilableness. We lug in the poltergeists, because some of our own data, or alleged\ndata, merge away indistinguishably with data, or alleged data, of them:\n\nInstances of stones that have been thrown, or that have fallen, upon a\nsmall area, from an unseen and undetectable source. London _Times_, about 1872:\n\n\"From 4 o'clock, Thursday afternoon, until half past eleven, Thursday\nnight, the houses, 56 and 58 Reverdy Road, Bermondsey, were assailed\nwith stones and other missiles coming from an unseen quarter. Two\nchildren were injured, every window broken, and several articles of\nfurniture were destroyed. Although there was a strong body of policemen\nscattered in the neighborhood, they could not trace the direction whence\nthe stones were thrown.\"\n\n\"Other missiles\" make a complication here. But if the expression means\ntin cans and old shoes, and if we accept that the direction could not be\ntraced because it never occurred to anyone to look upward--why, we've\nlost a good deal of our provincialism by this time. London _Times_, Sept. 16, 1841:\n\nThat, in the home of Mrs. Charton, at Sutton Courthouse, Sutton Lane,\nChiswick, windows had been broken \"by some unseen agent.\" Every attempt\nto detect the perpetrator failed. The mansion was detached and\nsurrounded by high walls. No other building was near it. The police were called. Two constables, assisted by members of the\nhousehold, guarded the house, but the windows continued to be broken\n\"both in front and behind the house.\"\n\nOr the floating islands that are often stationary in the Super-Sargasso\nSea; and atmospheric disturbances that sometimes affect them, and bring\nthings down within small areas, upon this earth, from temporarily\nstationary sources. Super-Sargasso Sea and the beaches of its floating islands from which I\nthink, or at least accept, pebbles have fallen:\n\nWolverhampton, England, June, 1860--violent storm--fall of so many\nlittle black pebbles that they were cleared away by shoveling (_La Sci. Pour Tous_, 5-264); great number of small black stones that fell at\nBirmingham, England, August, 1858--violent storm--said to be similar to\nsome basalt a few leagues from Birmingham (_Rept. Brit. Assoc._,\n1864-37); pebbles described as \"common water-worn pebbles\" that fell at\nPalestine, Texas, about 1888--\"of a formation not found near\nPalestine\" (W.H. Perry, Sergeant, Signal Corps, _Monthly Weather\nReview_, July, 1888); round, smooth pebbles at Kandahor, 1834 (_Am. J. Sci._, 1-26-161); \"a number of stones of peculiar formation and shapes,\nunknown in this neighborhood, fell in a tornado at Hillsboro, Ill., in the middle of the decade of the 1880s.\" (_Monthly Weather Review_, May, 1883.)\n\nPebbles from aerial beaches and terrestrial pebbles as products of\nwhirlwinds, so merge in these instances that, though it's interesting to\nhear of things of peculiar shape that have fallen from the sky, it seems\nbest to pay little attention here, and to find phenomena of the\nSuper-Sargasso Sea remote from the merger:\n\nTo this requirement we have three adaptations:\n\nPebbles that fell where no whirlwind to which to attribute them could be\nlearned of:\n\nPebbles which fell in hail so large that incredibly could that hail have\nbeen formed in this earth's atmosphere:\n\nPebbles which fell and were, long afterward, followed by more pebbles,\nas if from some aerial, stationary source, in the same place.

In\nSeptember, 1898, there was a story in a New York newspaper, of\nlightning--or an appearance of luminosity?--in Jamaica--something had\nstruck a tree: near the tree were found some small pebbles. It was said\nthat the pebbles had fallen from the sky, with the lightning. But the\ninsult to orthodoxy was that they were not angular fragments such as\nmight have been broken from a stony meteorite: that they were\n\"water-worn pebbles.\"\n\nIn the geographical vagueness of a mainland, the explanation \"up from\none place and down in another\" is always good, and is never overworked,\nuntil the instances are massed as they are in this book: but, upon this\noccasion, in the relatively small area of Jamaica, there was no\nwhirlwind findable--however \"there in the first place\" bobs up. _Monthly Weather Review_, August, 1898-363:\n\nThat the government meteorologist had investigated: had reported that a\ntree had been struck by lightning, and that small water-worn pebbles had\nbeen found near the tree: but that similar pebbles could be found all\nover Jamaica. _Monthly Weather Review_, September, 1915-446:\n\nProf. Fassig gives an account of a fall of hail that occurred in\nMaryland, about 1915: hailstones the size of baseballs \"not at all\nuncommon.\"\n\n\"An interesting, but unconfirmed, account stated that small pebbles were\nfound at the center of some of the larger hail gathered at Annapolis. The young man who related the story offered to produce the pebbles, but\nhas not done so.\"\n\nA footnote:\n\n\"Since writing this, the author states that he has received some of the\npebbles.\"\n\nWhen a young man \"produces\" pebbles, that's as convincing as anything\nelse I've ever heard of, though no more convincing than, if having told\nof ham sandwiches falling from the sky, he should \"produce\" ham\nsandwiches. If this \"reluctance\" be admitted by us, we correlate it with\na datum reported by a Weather Bureau observer, signifying that, whether\nthe pebbles had been somewhere aloft a long time or not, some of the\nhailstones that fell with them, had been. The datum is that some of\nthese hailstones were composed of from twenty to twenty-five layers\nalternately of clear ice and snow-ice. In orthodox terms I argue that a\nfair-sized hailstone falls from the clouds with velocity sufficient to\nwarm it so that it would not take on even one layer of ice. To put on\ntwenty layers of ice, I conceive of something that had not fallen at\nall, but had rolled somewhere, at a leisurely rate, for a long time. We now have a commonplace datum that is familiar in two respects:\n\nLittle, symmetric objects of metal that fell at Orenburg, Russia,\nSeptember, 1824 (_Phil. Mag._, 4-8-463). A second fall of these objects, at Orenburg, Russia, Jan. 25, 1825\n(_Quar. Jour. Roy. Inst._, 1828-1-447). I now think of the disk of Tarbes, but when first I came upon these data\nI was impressed only with recurrence, because the objects of Orenburg\nwere described as crystals of pyrites, or sulphate of iron. I had no\nnotion of metallic objects that might have been shaped or molded by\nmeans other than crystallization, until I came to Arago's account of\nthese occurrences (_OEuvres_, 11-644). Here the analysis gives 70 per\ncent. red oxide of iron, and sulphur and loss by ignition 5 per cent. It\nseems to me acceptable that iron with considerably less than 5 per cent. sulphur in it is not iron pyrites--then little, rusty iron objects,\nshaped by some other means, have fallen, four months apart, at the same\nplace. M. Arago expresses astonishment at this phenomenon of recurrence\nso familiar to us. Altogether, I find opening before us, vistas of heresies to which I, for\none, must shut my eyes. I have always been in sympathy with the\ndogmatists and exclusionists: that is plain in our opening lines: that\nto seem to be is falsely and arbitrarily and dogmatically to exclude. It\nis only that exclusionists who are good in the nineteenth century are\nevil in the twentieth century. Constantly we feel a merging away into\ninfinitude; but that this book shall approximate to form, or that our\ndata shall approximate to organization, or that we shall approximate to\nintelligibility, we have to call ourselves back constantly from\nwandering off into infinitude. The thing that we do, however, is to make\nour own outline, or the difference between what we include and what we\nexclude, vague.",

The thing that we do, however, is to make\nour own outline, or the difference between what we include and what we\nexclude, vague. The crux here, and the limit beyond which we may not go--very much--is:\n\nAcceptance that there is a region that we call the Super-Sargasso\nSea--not yet fully accepted, but a provisional position that has\nreceived a great deal of support--\n\nBut is it a part of this earth, and does it revolve with and over this\nearth--\n\nOr does it flatly overlie this earth, not revolving with and over this\nearth--\n\nThat this earth does not revolve, and is not round, or roundish, at all,\nbut is continuous with the rest of its system, so that, if one could\nbreak away from the traditions of the geographers, one might walk and\nwalk, and come to Mars, and then find Mars continuous with Jupiter? I suppose some day such queries will sound absurd--the thing will be so\nobvious--\n\nBecause it is very difficult for me to conceive of little metallic\nobjects hanging precisely over a small town in Russia, for four months,\nif revolving, unattached, with a revolving earth--\n\nIt may be that something aimed at that town, and then later took another\nshot. These are speculations that seem to me to be evil relatively to these\nearly years in the twentieth century--\n\nJust now, I accept that this earth is--not round, of course: that is\nvery old-fashioned--but roundish, or, at least, that it has what is\ncalled form of its own, and does revolve upon its axis, and in an orbit\naround the sun. I only accept these old traditional notions--\n\nAnd that above it are regions of suspension that revolve with it: from\nwhich objects fall, by disturbances of various kinds, and then, later,\nfall again, in the same place:\n\n_Monthly Weather Review_, May, 1884-134:\n\nReport from the Signal Service observer, at Bismarck, Dakota:\n\nThat, at 9 o'clock, in the evening of about 1884, sharp sounds were\nheard throughout the city, caused by a fall of flinty stones striking\nagainst windows. Fifteen hours later another fall of flinty stones occurred at Bismarck. There is no report of stones having fallen anywhere else. This is a thing of the ultra-damned. All Editors of scientific\npublications read the _Monthly Weather Review_ and frequently copy from\nit. The noise made by the stones of Bismarck, rattling against those\nwindows, may be in a language that aviators will some day interpret:\nbut it was a noise entirely surrounded by silences. Of this ultra-damned\nthing, there is no mention, findable by me, in any other publication. The size of some hailstones has worried many meteorologists--but not\ntext-book meteorologists. I know of no more serene occupation than that\nof writing text-books--though writing for the _War Cry_, of the\nSalvation Army, may be equally unadventurous. In the drowsy tranquillity\nof a text-book, we easily and unintelligently read of dust particles\naround which icy rain forms, hailstones, in their fall, then increasing\nby accretion--but in the meteorological journals, we read often of\nair-spaces nucleating hailstones--\n\nBut it's the size of the things. Dip a marble in icy water. Dip and dip\nand dip it. If you're a resolute dipper, you will, after a while, have\nan object the size of a baseball--but I think a thing could fall from\nthe moon in that length of time. Also the strata of them. The Maryland\nhailstones are unusual, but a dozen strata have often been counted. Ferrel gives an instance of thirteen strata. Such considerations led\nProf. Schwedoff to argue that some hailstones are not, and cannot, be\ngenerated in this earth's atmosphere--that they come from somewhere\nelse. Now, in a relative existence, nothing can of itself be either\nattractive or repulsive: its effects are functions of its associations\nor implications. Many of our data have been taken from very conservative\nscientific sources: it was not until their discordant implications, or\nirreconcilabilities with the System, were perceived, that\nexcommunication was pronounced against them. Prof. Schwedoff's paper was read before the British Association (_Rept. of 1882_, p. 453). The implication, and the repulsiveness of the implication to the snug\nand tight little exclusionists of 1882--though we hold out that they\nwere functioning well and ably relatively to 1882--\n\nThat there is water--oceans or lakes and ponds, or rivers of it--that\nthere is water away from, and yet not far-remote from, this earth's\natmosphere and gravitation--\n\nThe pain of it:\n\nThat the snug little system of 1882 would be ousted from its\nreposefulness--\n\nA whole new science to learn:\n\nThe Science of Super-Geography--\n\nAnd Science is a turtle that says that its own shell encloses all\nthings. So the members of the British Association. To some of them Prof. Schwedoff's ideas were like slaps on the back of an environment-denying\nturtle: to some of them his heresy was like an offering of meat, raw and\ndripping, to milk-fed lambs.",

To some of them Prof. Schwedoff's ideas were like slaps on the back of an environment-denying\nturtle: to some of them his heresy was like an offering of meat, raw and\ndripping, to milk-fed lambs. Some of them bleated like lambs, and some\nof them turled like turtles. We used to crucify, but now we ridicule:\nor, in the loss of vigor of all progress, the spike has etherealized\ninto the laugh. Sir William Thomson ridiculed the heresy, with the phantomosities of his\nera:\n\nThat all bodies, such as hailstones, if away from this earth's\natmosphere, would have to move at planetary velocity--which would be\npositively reasonable if the pronouncements of St. Isaac were anything\nbut articles of faith--that a hailstone falling through this earth's\natmosphere, with planetary velocity, would perform 13,000 times as much\nwork as would raise an equal weight of water one degree centigrade, and\ntherefore never fall as a hailstone at all; be more than\nmelted--super-volatalized--\n\nThese turls and these bleats of pedantry--though we insist that,\nrelatively to 1882, these turls and bleats should be regarded as\nrespectfully as we regard rag dolls that keep infants occupied and\nnoiseless--it is the survival of rag dolls into maturity that we object\nto--so these pious and na\u00efve ones who believed that 13,000 times\nsomething could have--that is, in quasi-existence--an exact and\ncalculable resultant, whereas there is--in quasi-existence--nothing that\ncan, except by delusion and convenience, be called a unit, in the first\nplace--whose devotions to St. Isaac required blind belief in formulas of\nfalling bodies--\n\nAgainst data that were piling up, in their own time, of slow-falling\nmeteorites; \"milk warm\" ones admitted even by Farrington and Merrill; at\nleast one icy meteorite nowhere denied by the present orthodoxy, a datum\nas accessible to Thomson, in 1882, as it is now to us, because it was an\noccurrence of 1860. Beans and needles and tacks and a magnet. Needles\nand tacks adhere to and systematize relatively to a magnet, but, if some\nbeans, too, be caught up, they are irreconcilables to this system and\ndrop right out of it. A member of the Salvation Army may hear over and\nover data that seem so memorable to an evolutionist. It seems remarkable\nthat they do not influence him--one finds that he cannot remember them. It is incredible that Sir William Thomson had never heard of\nslow-falling, cold meteorites. It is simply that he had no power to\nremember such irreconcilabilities. And then Mr. Symons again. Mr. Symons was a man who probably did more\nfor the science of meteorology than did any other man of his time:\ntherefore he probably did more to hold back the science of meteorology\nthan did any other man of his time. In _Nature_, 41-135, Mr. Symons says\nthat Prof. Schwedoff's ideas are \"very droll.\"\n\nI think that even more amusing is our own acceptance that, not very far\nabove this earth's surface, is a region that will be the subject of a\nwhole new science--super-geography--with which we shall immortalize\nourselves in the resentments of the schoolboys of the future--\n\nPebbles and fragments of meteors and things from Mars and Jupiter and\nAzuria: wedges, delayed messages, cannon balls, bricks, nails, coal and\ncoke and charcoal and offensive old cargoes--things that coat in ice in\nsome regions and things that get into areas so warm that they\nputrefy--or that there are all the climates of geography in\nsuper-geography. I shall have to accept that, floating in the sky of\nthis earth, there often are fields of ice as extensive as those on the\nArctic Ocean--volumes of water in which are many fishes and\nfrogs--tracts of land covered with caterpillars--\n\nAviators of the future. They fly up and up. Then they get out and walk. The fishing's good: the bait's right there. They find messages from\nother worlds--and within three weeks there's a big trade worked up in\nforged messages. Sometime I shall write a guide book to the\nSuper-Sargasso Sea, for aviators, but just at present there wouldn't be\nmuch call for it. We now have more of our expression upon hail as a concomitant, or more\ndata of things that have fallen from the sky, with hail. In general, the expression is:\n\nThese things may have been raised from some other part of the earth's\nsurface, in whirlwinds, or may not have fallen, and may have been upon\nthe ground, in the first place--but were the hailstones found with them,\nraised from some other part of the earth's surface, or were the\nhailstones upon the ground, in the first place? As I said before, this expression is meaningless as to a few instances;\nit is reasonable to think of some coincidence between the fall of hail\nand the fall of other things: but, inasmuch as there have been a good\nmany instances,--we begin to suspect that this is not so much a book\nwe're writing as a sanitarium for overworked coincidences.",

If not\nconceivably could very large hailstones and lumps of ice form in this\nearth's atmosphere, and so then had to come from external regions, then\nother things in or accompanying very large hailstones and lumps of ice\ncame from external regions--which worries us a little: we may be\ninstantly translated to the Positive Absolute. _Cosmos_, 13-120, quotes a Virginia newspaper, that fishes said to have\nbeen catfishes, a foot long, some of them, had fallen, in 1853, at\nNorfolk, Virginia, with hail. Vegetable d\u00e9bris, not only nuclear, but frozen upon the surfaces of\nlarge hailstones, at Toulouse, France, in the middle of the decade of the 1870s. (_La Science Pour\nTous_, 1874-270.)\n\nDescription of a storm, at Pontiac, Canada, in the middle of the decade of the 1860s, in which it\nis said that it was not hailstones that fell, but \"pieces of ice, from\nhalf an inch to over two inches in diameter\" (_Canadian Naturalist_,\n2-1-308):\n\n\"But the most extraordinary thing is that a respectable farmer, of\nundoubted veracity, says he picked up a piece of hail, or ice, in the\ncenter of which was a small green frog.\"\n\nStorm at Dubuque, Iowa, about 1882, in which fell hailstones and\npieces of ice (_Monthly Weather Review_, June, 1882):\n\n\"The foreman of the Novelty Iron Works, of this city, states that in two\nlarge hailstones melted by him were found small living frogs.\" But the\npieces of ice that fell upon this occasion had a peculiarity that\nindicates--though by as bizarre an indication as any we've had yet--that\nthey had been for a long time motionless or floating somewhere. We'll\ntake that up soon. _Living Age_, 52-186:\n\nThat, about 1841, fishes, one of which was ten inches long, fell at\nBoston; that, eight days later, fishes and ice fell at Derby. In Timb's _Year Book_, 1842-275, it is said that, at Derby, the fishes\nhad fallen in enormous numbers; from half an inch to two inches long,\nand some considerably larger. In the _Athen\u00e6um_, 1841-542, copied from\nthe Sheffield _Patriot_, it is said that one of the fishes weighed three\nounces. In several accounts, it is said that, with the fishes, fell many\nsmall frogs and \"pieces of half-melted ice.\" We are told that the frogs\nand the fishes had been raised from some other part of the earth's\nsurface, in a whirlwind; no whirlwind specified; nothing said as to what\npart of the earth's surface comes ice, in the month of July--interests\nus that the ice is described as \"half-melted.\" In the London _Times_,\nabout 1841, it is said that the fishes were sticklebacks; that they\nhad fallen with ice and small frogs, many of which had survived the\nfall. We note that, at Dunfermline, three months later (Oct. 7, 1841)\nfell many fishes, several inches in length, in a thunderstorm. (London\n_Times_, Oct. 12, 1841.)\n\nHailstones, we don't care so much about. The matter of stratification\nseems significant, but we think more of the fall of lumps of ice from\nthe sky, as possible data of the Super-Sargasso Sea:\n\nLumps of ice, a foot in circumference, Derbyshire, England, about 1811\n(_Annual Register_, 1811-54); cuboidal mass, six inches in diameter,\nthat fell at Birmingham, 26 days later (Thomson, _Intro. to\nMeteorology_, p. 179); size of pumpkins, Bangalore, India, about 1851\n(_Rept. Brit. Assoc._, 1855-35); masses of ice of a pound and a half\neach, New Hampshire, Aug. 13, 1851 (Lummis, _Meteorology_, p. 129);\nmasses of ice, size of a man's head, in the Delphos tornado (Ferrel,\n_Popular Treatise_, p. 428); large as a man's hand, killing thousands of\nsheep, Texas, late in the decade of the 1870s (_Monthly Weather Review_, May, 1877); \"pieces\nof ice so large that they could not be grasped in one hand,\" in a\ntornado, in Colorado, about 1877 (_Monthly Weather Review_, June,\n1877); lumps of ice four and a half inches long, Richmond, England, Aug. 2, 1879 (_Symons' Met. Mag._, 14-100); mass of ice, 21 inches in\ncircumference that fell with hail, Iowa, June, 1881 (_Monthly Weather\nReview_, June, 1881); \"pieces of ice\" eight inches long, and an inch and\na half thick, Davenport, Iowa, Aug. 30, 1882 (_Monthly Weather Review_,\nAug., 1882); lump of ice size of a brick; weight two pounds, Chicago,\nabout 1883 (_Monthly Weather Review_, July, 1883); lumps of ice that\nweighed one pound and a half each, India, May (?), 1888 (_Nature_,\n37-42); lump of ice weighing four pounds, Texas, Dec. 6, 1893 (_Sc. Am._, 68-58); lumps of ice one pound in weight, Nov. 14, 1901, in a\ntornado, Victoria (_Meteorology of Australia_, p. 34). Of course it is our acceptance that these masses not only accompanied\ntornadoes, but were brought down to this earth by tornadoes. Flammarion, _The Atmosphere_, p.",

Mag._, 14-100); mass of ice, 21 inches in\ncircumference that fell with hail, Iowa, June, 1881 (_Monthly Weather\nReview_, June, 1881); \"pieces of ice\" eight inches long, and an inch and\na half thick, Davenport, Iowa, Aug. 30, 1882 (_Monthly Weather Review_,\nAug., 1882); lump of ice size of a brick; weight two pounds, Chicago,\nabout 1883 (_Monthly Weather Review_, July, 1883); lumps of ice that\nweighed one pound and a half each, India, May (?), 1888 (_Nature_,\n37-42); lump of ice weighing four pounds, Texas, Dec. 6, 1893 (_Sc. Am._, 68-58); lumps of ice one pound in weight, Nov. 14, 1901, in a\ntornado, Victoria (_Meteorology of Australia_, p. 34). Of course it is our acceptance that these masses not only accompanied\ntornadoes, but were brought down to this earth by tornadoes. Flammarion, _The Atmosphere_, p. 34:\n\nBlock of ice, weighing four and a half pounds that fell at Cazorta,\nSpain, about 1829; block of ice, weighing eleven pounds, at Cette,\nFrance, October, 1844; mass of ice three feet long, three feet wide, and\nmore than two feet thick, that fell, in a storm, in Hungary, about 1802. _Scientific American_, 47-119:\n\nThat, according to the _Salina Journal_, a mass of ice weighing about 80\npounds had fallen from the sky, near Salina, Kansas, August, 1882. We\nare told that Mr. W.J. Hagler, the North Santa F\u00e9 merchant became\npossessor of it, and packed it in sawdust in his store. London _Times_, about 1860:\n\nThat, upon the 16th of March, 1860, in a snowstorm, in Upper Wasdale,\nblocks of ice, so large that at a distance they looked like a flock of\nsheep, had fallen. _Rept. Brit. Assoc._, 1851-32:\n\nThat a mass of ice about a cubic yard in size had fallen at Candeish,\nIndia, 1828. Against these data, though, so far as I know, so many of them have never\nbeen assembled together before, there is a silence upon the part of\nscientific men that is unusual. Our Super-Sargasso Sea may not be an\nunavoidable conclusion, but arrival upon this earth of ice from external\nregions does seem to be--except that there must be, be it ever so faint,\na merger. It is in the notion that these masses of ice are only\ncongealed hailstones. We have data against this notion, as applied to\nall our instances, but the explanation has been offered, and, it seems\nto me, may apply in some instances. In the _Bull. Soc. Astro. de\nFrance_, 20-245, it is said of blocks of ice the size of decanters that\nhad fallen at Tunis that they were only masses of congealed hailstones. London _Times_, Aug. 4, 1857. That a block of ice, described as \"pure\" ice, weighing 25 pounds, had\nbeen found in the meadow of Mr. Warner, of Cricklewood. There had been a\nstorm the day before. As in some of our other instances, no one had seen\nthis object fall from the sky. It was found after the storm: that's all\nthat can be said about it. Letter from Capt. Blakiston, communicated by Gen. Sabine, to the Royal\nSociety (_London Roy. Soc. Proc._, 10-468):\n\nThat, Jan. 14, 1860, in a thunderstorm, pieces of ice had fallen upon\nCapt. Blakiston's vessel--that it was not hail. \"It was not hail, but\nirregular-shaped pieces of solid ice of different dimensions, up to the\nsize of half a brick.\"\n\nAccording to the _Advertiser-Scotsman_, quoted by the Edinburgh _New\nPhilosophical Magazine_, 47-371, an irregular-shaped mass of ice fell at\nOrd, Scotland, August, 1849, after \"an extraordinary peal of thunder.\"\n\nIt is said that this was homogeneous ice, except in a small part, which\nlooked like congealed hailstones. The mass was about 20 feet in circumference. The story, as told in the London _Times_, Aug. 14, 1849, is that, upon\nthe evening of the 13th of August, 1849, after a loud peal of thunder, a\nmass of ice said to have been 20 feet in circumference, had fallen upon\nthe estate of Mr. Moffat, of Balvullich, Ross-shire. It is said that\nthis object fell alone, or without hailstones. Altogether, though it is not so strong for the Super-Sargasso Sea, I\nthink this is one of our best expressions upon external origins. That\nlarge blocks of ice could form in the moisture of this earth's\natmosphere is about as likely as that blocks of stone could form in a\ndust whirl. Of course, if ice or water comes to this earth from external\nsources, we think of at least minute organisms in it, and on, with our\ndata, to frogs, fishes; on to anything that's thinkable, coming from\nexternal sources. It's of great importance to us to accept that large\nlumps of ice have fallen from the sky, but what we desire most--perhaps\nbecause of our interest in its archaeologic and palaeontologic\ntreasures--is now to be through with tentativeness and probation, and\nto take the Super-Sargasso Sea into full acceptance in our more advanced\nfold of the chosen of this twentieth century. In the _Report of the British Association_, 1855-37, it is said that, at\nPoorhundur, India, Dec. 11, 1854, flat pieces of ice, many of them\nweighing several pounds--each, I suppose--had fallen from the sky. They\nare described as \"large ice-flakes.\"\n\nVast fields of ice in the Super-Arctic regions, or strata, of the\nSuper-Sargasso Sea. When they break up, their fragments are flake-like. In our acceptance, there are aerial ice-fields that are remote from this\nearth; that break up, fragments grinding against one another, rolling in\nvapor and water, of different constituency in different regions, forming\nslowly as stratified hailstones--but that there are ice-fields near this\nearth, that break up into just such flat pieces of ice as cover any pond\nor river when ice of a pond or river is broken, and are sometimes soon\nprecipitated to the earth, in this familiar flat formation. _Symons' Met.",

Mag._, 43-154:\n\nA correspondent writes that, at Braemar, about 1908, when the sky was\nclear overhead, and the sun shining, flat pieces of ice fell--from\nsomewhere. The sun was shining, but something was going on somewhere:\nthunder was heard. Until I saw the reproduction of a photograph in the _Scientific\nAmerican_, Feb. 21, 1914, I had supposed that these ice-fields must be,\nsay, at least ten or twenty miles away from this earth, and invisible,\nto terrestrial observers, except as the blurs that have so often been\nreported by astronomers and meteorologists. The photograph published by\nthe _Scientific American_ is of an aggregation supposed to be clouds,\npresumably not very high, so clearly detailed are they. The writer says\nthat they looked to him like \"a field of broken ice.\" Beneath is a\npicture of a conventional field of ice, floating ordinarily in water. The resemblance between the two pictures is striking--nevertheless, it\nseems to me incredible that the first of the photographs could be of an\naerial ice-field, or that gravitation could cease to act at only a mile\nor so from this earth's surface--\n\nUnless:\n\nThe exceptional: the flux and vagary of all things. Or that normally this earth's gravitation extends, say, ten or fifteen\nmiles outward--but that gravitation must be rhythmic. Of course, in the pseudo-formulas of astronomers, gravitation as a fixed\nquantity is essential. Accept that gravitation is a variable force, and\nastronomers deflate, with a perceptible hissing sound, into the\npunctured condition of economists, biologists, meteorologists, and all\nthe others of the humbler divinities, who can admittedly offer only\ninsecure approximations. We refer all who would not like to hear the hiss of escaping arrogance,\nto Herbert Spencer's chapters upon the rhythm of all phenomena. If everything else--light from the stars, heat from the sun, the winds\nand the tides; forms and colors and sizes of animals; demands and\nsupplies and prices; political opinions and chemic reactions and\nreligious doctrines and magnetic intensities and the ticking of clocks;\nand arrival and departure of the seasons--if everything else is\nvariable, we accept that the notion of gravitation as fixed and\nformulable is only another attempted positivism, doomed, like all other\nillusions of realness in quasi-existence. So it is intermediatism to\naccept that, though gravitation may approximate higher to invariability\nthan do the winds, for instance, it must be somewhere between the\nAbsolutes of Stability and Instability. Here then we are not much\nimpressed with the opposition of physicists and astronomers, fearing, a\nlittle mournfully, that their language is of expiring sibilations. So then the fields of ice in the sky, and that, though usually so far\naway as to be mere blurs, at times they come close enough to be seen in\ndetail. For description of what I call a \"blur,\" see _Pop. Sci. News_,\nFebruary, 1884--sky, in general, unusually clear, but, near the sun, \"a\nwhite, slightly curdled haze, which was dazzlingly bright.\"\n\nWe accept that sometimes fields of ice pass between the sun and the\nearth: that many strata of ice, or very thick fields of ice, or\nsuperimposed fields would obscure the sun--that there have been\noccasions when the sun was eclipsed by fields of ice:\n\nFlammarion, _The Atmosphere_, p. 394:\n\nThat a profound darkness came upon the city of Brussels, about 1830s:\n\nThere fell flat pieces of ice, an inch long. Intense darkness at Aitkin, Minn., about 1880s: sand and \"solid chunks\nof ice\" reported to have fallen (_Science_, about 1889). In _Symons' Meteorological Magazine_, 32-172, are outlined rough-edged\nbut smooth-surfaced pieces of ice that fell at Manassas, Virginia, Aug. 10, 1897. They look as much like the roughly broken fragments of a\nsmooth sheet of ice--as ever have roughly broken fragments of a smooth\nsheet of ice looked. About two inches across, and one inch thick. In\n_Cosmos_, 3-116, it is said that, at Rouen, about 1853, fell\nirregular-shaped pieces of ice, about the size of a hand, described as\nlooking as if all had been broken from one enormous block of ice. That,\nI think, was an aerial iceberg. In the awful density, or almost absolute\nstupidity of the the 19th century, it never occurred to anybody to look for\ntraces of polar bears or of seals upon these fragments. Of course, seeing what we want to see, having been able to gather these\ndata only because they are in agreement with notions formed in advance,\nwe are not so respectful to our own notions as to a similar impression\nforced upon an observer who had no theory or acceptance to support. In\ngeneral, our prejudices see and our prejudices investigate, but this\nshould not be taken as an absolute. _Monthly Weather Review_, July, 1894:\n\nThat, from the Weather Bureau, of Portland, Oregon, a tornado, of in the middle of the decade of the 1890s, was reported.

Fragments of ice fell from the sky. They averaged three to four inches square, and about an inch thick. In\nlength and breadth they had the smooth surfaces required by our\nacceptance: and, according to the writer in the _Review_, \"gave the\nimpression of a vast field of ice suspended in the atmosphere, and\nsuddenly broken into fragments about the size of the palm of the hand.\"\n\nThis datum, profoundly of what we used to call the \"damned,\" or before\nwe could no longer accept judgment, or cut and dried condemnation by\ninfants, turtles, and lambs, was copied--but without comment--in the\n_Scientific American_, 71-371. Our theology is something like this:\n\nOf course we ought to be damned--but we revolt against adjudication by\ninfants, turtles, and lambs. We now come to some remarkable data in a rather difficult department of\nsuper-geography. Vast fields of aerial ice. There's a lesson to me in\nthe treachery of the imaginable. Most of our opposition is in the\nclearness with which the conventional, but impossible, becomes the\nimaginable, and then the resistant to modifications. After it had become\nthe conventional with me, I conceived clearly of vast sheets of ice, a\nfew miles above this earth--then the shining of the sun, and the ice\npartly melting--that note upon the ice that fell at Derby--water\ntrickling and forming icicles upon the lower surface of the ice sheet. I\nseemed to look up and so clearly visualized those icicles hanging like\nstalactites from a flat-roofed cave, in white calcite. Or I looked up at\nthe under side of an aerial ice-lump, and seemed to see a papillation\nsimilar to that observed by a calf at times. But then--but then--if\nicicles should form upon the under side of a sheet of aerial ice, that\nwould be by the falling of water toward this earth; an icicle is of\ncourse an expression of gravitation--and, if water melting from ice\nshould fall toward this earth, why not the ice itself fall before an\nicicle could have time to form? Of course, in quasi-existence, where\neverything is a paradox, one might argue that the water falls, but the\nice does not, because the ice is heavier--that is, in masses. That\nnotion, I think, belongs in a more advanced course than we are taking at\npresent. Our expression upon icicles:\n\nA vast field of aerial ice--it is inert to this earth's gravitation--but\nby universal flux and variation, part of it sags closer to this earth,\nand is susceptible to gravitation--by cohesion with the main mass, this\npart does not fall, but water melting from it does fall, and forms\nicicles--then, by various disturbances, this part sometimes falls in\nfragments that are protrusive with icicles. Of the ice that fell, some of it enclosing living frogs, at Dubuque,\nIowa, about 1882, it is said (_Monthly Weather Review_, June, 1882)\nthat there were pieces from one to seventeen inches in circumference,\nthe largest weighing one pound and three-quarters--that upon some of\nthem were icicles half an inch in length. We emphasize that these\nobjects were not hailstones. The only merger is that of knobby hailstones, or of large hailstones\nwith protuberances wrought by crystallization: but that is no merger\nwith terrestrial phenomena, and such formations are unaccountable to\northodoxy; or it is incredible that hail could so crystallize--not\nforming by accretion--in the fall of a few seconds. For an account of\nsuch hailstones, see _Nature_, 61-594. Note the size--\"some of them the\nsize of turkeys' eggs.\"\n\nIt is our expression that sometimes the icicles themselves have fallen,\nas if by concussion, or as if something had swept against the under side\nof an aerial ice floe, detaching its papillations. _Monthly Weather Review_, June, 1889:\n\nThat, at Oswego, N.Y., about 1880s, according to the Turin (N.Y.)\n_Leader_, there fell, in a thunderstorm, pieces of ice that \"resembled\nthe fragments of icicles.\"\n\n_Monthly Weather Review_, 29-506:\n\nThat on Florence Island, St. Lawrence River, Aug. 8, 1901, with ordinary\nhail, fell pieces of ice \"formed like icicles, the size and shape of\nlead pencils that had been cut into sections about three-eighths of an\ninch in length.\"\n\nSo our data of the Super-Sargasso Sea, and its Arctic region: and, for\nweeks at a time, an ice field may hang motionless over a part of this\nearth's surface--the sun has some effect upon it, but not much until\nlate in the afternoon, I should say--part of it has sagged, but is held\nup by cohesion with the main mass--whereupon we have such an occurrence\nas would have been a little uncanny to us once upon a time--or fall of\nwater from a cloudless sky, day after day, in one small part of this\nearth's surface, late in the afternoon, when the sun's rays had had time\nfor their effects:\n\n_Monthly Weather Review_, October, 1886:\n\nThat, according to the Charlotte _Chronicle_, Oct.",

This is the newspaper account, and, as such, it seems in the depths of\nthe unchosen, either by me or any other expression of the Salvation\nArmy. The account by the Signal Service observer, at Charlotte,\npublished in the _Review_, follows:\n\n\"An unusual phenomenon was witnessed on the 21st: having been informed\nthat, for some weeks prior to date, rain had been falling daily, after 3\nP.M., on a particular spot, near two trees, corner of 9th and D streets,\nI visited the place, and saw precipitation in the form of rain drops at\n4:47 and 4:55 P.M., while the sun was shining brightly. On the 22nd, I\nagain visited the place, and from 4:05 to 4:25 P.M., a light shower of\nrain fell from a cloudless sky.... Sometimes the precipitation falls\nover an area of half an acre, but always appears to center at these two\ntrees, and when lightest occurs there only.\"\n\n\nWe see conventionally. It is not only that we think and act and speak\nand dress alike, because of our surrender to social attempt at Entity,\nin which we are only super-cellular. We see what it is \"proper\" that we\nshould see. It is orthodox enough to say that a horse is not a horse, to\nan infant--any more than is an orange an orange to the unsophisticated. It's interesting to walk along a street sometimes and look at things and\nwonder what they'd look like, if we hadn't been taught to see horses and\ntrees and houses as horses and trees and houses. I think that to\nsuper-sight they are local stresses merging indistinguishably into one\nanother, in an all-inclusive nexus. I think that it would be credible enough to say that many times have\nMonstrator and Elvera and Azuria crossed telescopic fields of vision,\nand were not even seen--because it wouldn't be proper to see them; it\nwouldn't be respectable, and it wouldn't be respectful: it would be\ninsulting to old bones to see them: it would bring on evil influences\nfrom the relics of St. Isaac to see them. But our data:\n\nOf vast worlds that are orbitless, or that are navigable, or that are\nadrift in inter-planetary tides and currents: the data that we shall\nhave of their approach, in modern times, within five or six miles of\nthis earth--\n\nBut then their visits, or approaches, to other planets, or to other of\nthe few regularized bodies that have surrendered to the attempted Entity\nof this solar system as a whole--\n\nThe question that we can't very well evade:\n\nHave these other worlds, or super-constructions, ever been seen by\nastronomers? I think there would not be much approximation to realness in taking\nrefuge in the notion of astronomers who stare and squint and see only\nthat which it is respectable and respectful to see. It is all very well\nto say that astronomers are hypnotics, and that an astronomer looking at\nthe moon is hypnotized by the moon, but our acceptance is that the\nbodies of this present expression often visit the moon, or cross it, or\nare held in temporary suspension near it--then some of them must often\nhave been within the diameter of an astronomer's hypnosis. Our general expression:\n\nThat, upon the oceans of this earth, there are regularized vessels, but\nalso that there are tramp vessels:\n\nThat, upon the super-ocean, there are regularized planets, but also that\nthere are tramp worlds:\n\nThat astronomers are like mercantile purists who would deny commercial\nvagabondage. Our acceptance is that vast celestial vagabonds have been excluded by\nastronomers, primarily because their irresponsibilities are an affront\nto the pure and the precise, or to attempted positivism; and secondarily\nbecause they have not been seen so very often. The planets steadily\nreflect the light of the sun: upon this uniformity a system that we call\nPrimary Astronomy has been built up; but now the subject-matter of\nAdvanced Astronomy is data of celestial phenomena that are sometimes\nlight and sometimes dark, varying like some of the satellites of\nJupiter, but with a wider range. However, light or dark, they have been\nseen and reported so often that the only important reason for their\nexclusion is--that they don't fit in. With dark bodies that are probably external to our own solar system, I\nhave, in the provincialism that no one can escape, not much concern.

With dark bodies that are probably external to our own solar system, I\nhave, in the provincialism that no one can escape, not much concern. Dark bodies afloat in outer space would have been damned a few years\nago, but now they're sanctioned by Prof. Barnard--and, if he says\nthey're all right, you may think of them without the fear of doing\nsomething wrong or ridiculous--the close kinship we note so often\nbetween the evil and the absurd--I suppose by the ridiculous I mean the\nfroth of evil. The dark companion of Algol, for instance. Though that's\na clear case of celestial miscegenation, the purists, or positivists,\nadmit that's so. In the _Proceedings of the National Academy of\nScience_, 1915-394, Prof. Barnard writes of an object--he calls it an\n\"object\"--in Cephus. His idea is that there are dark, opaque bodies\noutside this solar system. But in the _Astrophysical Journal_, 1916-1,\nhe modifies into regarding them as \"dark nebul\u00e6.\" That's not so\ninteresting. We accept that Venus, for instance, has often been visited by other\nworlds, or by super-constructions, from which come ciders and coke and\ncoal; that sometimes these things have reflected light and have been\nseen from this earth--by professional astronomers. It will be noted that\nthroughout this chapter our data are accursed Brahmins--as, by hypnosis\nand inertia, we keep on and keep on saying, just as a good many of the\nscientists of the the 19th century kept on and kept on admitting the power\nof the system that preceded them--or Continuity would be smashed. There's a big chance here for us to be instantaneously translated to the\nPositive Absolute--oh, well--\n\nWhat I emphasize here is that our damned data are observations by\nastronomers of the highest standing, excommunicated by astronomers of\nsimilar standing--but backed up by the dominant spirit of their era--to\nwhich all minds had to equilibrate or be negligible, unheard, submerged. It would seem sometimes, in this book, as if our revolts were against\nthe dogmatisms and pontifications of single scientists of eminence. This\nis only a convenience, because it seems necessary to personify. If we\nlook over _Philosophical Transactions_, or the publications of the Royal\nAstronomical Society, for instance, we see that Herschel, for instance,\nwas as powerless as any boy stargazer, to enforce acceptance of any\nobservation of his that did not harmonize with the system that was\ngrowing up as independently of him and all other astronomers, as a phase\nin the development of an embryo compels all cells to take on appearances\nconcordantly with the design and the predetermined progress and schedule\nof the whole. Visitors to Venus:\n\nEvans, _Ways of the Planets_, p. 140:\n\nThat, in 1645, a body large enough to look like a satellite was seen\nnear Venus. Four times in the first half of the the 18th century, a similar\nobservation was reported. The last report occurred in 1767. A large body has been seen--seven times, according to _Science Gossip_,\n1886-178--near Venus. At least one astronomer, Houzeau, accepted these\nobservations and named the--world, planet, super-construction--\"Neith.\"\nHis views are mentioned \"in passing, but without endorsement,\" in the\n_Trans. N.Y. Acad._, 5-249. Houzeau or someone writing for the magazine-section of a Sunday\nnewspaper--outer darkness for both alike. A new satellite in this solar\nsystem might be a little disturbing--though the formulas of Laplace,\nwhich were considered final in his day, have survived the admittance of\nfive or six hundred bodies not included in those formulas--a satellite\nto Venus might be a little disturbing, but would be explained--but a\nlarge body approaching a planet--staying awhile--going away--coming back\nsome other time--anchoring, as it were--\n\nAzuria is pretty bad, but Azuria is no worse than Neith. _Astrophysical Journal_, 1-127:\n\nA light-reflecting body, or a bright spot near Mars: seen Nov. 25, 1894,\nby Prof. Pickering and others, at the Lowell Observatory, above an\nunilluminated part of Mars--self-luminous, it would seem--thought to\nhave been a cloud--but estimated to have been about twenty miles away\nfrom the planet.

Or that the science of Astronomy is a\nphantom-film distended with myth-stuff--but always our acceptance that\nit approximates higher to substantiality than did the system that\npreceded it. So Leverrier and the \"planet Vulcan.\"\n\nAnd we repeat, and it will do us small good to repeat. If you be of the\nmasses that the astronomers have hypnotized--being themselves\nhypnotized, or they could not hypnotize others--or that the hypnotist's\ncontrol is not the masterful power that it is popularly supposed to be,\nbut only transference of state from one hypnotic to another--\n\nIf you be of the masses that the astronomers have hypnotized, you will\nnot be able even to remember. Ten pages from here, and Leverrier and the\n\"planet Vulcan\" will have fallen from your mind, like beans from a\nmagnet, or like data of cold meteorites from the mind of a Thomson. Leverrier and the \"planet Vulcan.\"\n\nAnd much the good it will do us to repeat. But at least temporarily we shall have an impression of a historic\nfiasco, such as, in our acceptance, could occur only in a\nquasi-existence. In 1859, Dr. Lescarbault, an amateur astronomer, of Org\u00e8res, France,\nannounced that, upon March 26, of that year, he had seen a body of\nplanetary size cross the sun. We are in a subject that is now as unholy\nto the present system as ever were its own subjects to the system that\npreceded it, or as ever were slanders against miracles to the preceding\nsystem. Nevertheless few text-books go so far as quite to disregard this\ntragedy. The method of the systematists is slightingly to give a few\ninstances of the unholy, and dispose of the few. If it were desirable to\nthem to deny that there are mountains upon this earth, they would record\na few observations upon some slight eminences near Orange, N.J., but say\nthat commuters, though estimable persons in several ways, are likely to\nhave their observations mixed. The text-books casually mention a few of\nthe \"supposed\" observations upon \"Vulcan,\" and then pass on. Dr. Lescarbault wrote to Leverrier, who hastened to Org\u00e8res--\n\nBecause this announcement assimilated with his own calculations upon a\nplanet between Mercury and the sun--\n\nBecause this solar system itself has never attained positiveness in the\naspect of Regularity: there are to Mercury, as there are to Neptune,\nphenomena irreconcilable with the formulas, or motions that betray\ninfluence by something else. We are told that Leverrier \"satisfied himself as to the substantial\naccuracy of the reported observation.\" The story of this investigation\nis told in _Monthly Notices_, 20-98. It seems too bad to threaten the\nna\u00efve little thing with our rude sophistications, but it is amusingly of\nthe ingenuousness of the age from which present dogmas have survived. Lescarbault wrote to Leverrier. Leverrier hastened to Org\u00e8res. But he\nwas careful not to tell Lescarbault who he was. Went right in and\n\"subjected Dr. Lescarbault to a very severe cross-examination\"--just the\nway you or I may feel at liberty to go into anybody's home and be severe\nwith people--\"pressing him hard step by step\"--just as anyone might go\ninto someone else's house and press him hard, though unknown to the\nhard-pressed one. Not until he was satisfied, did Leverrier reveal his\nidentity. I suppose Dr. Lescarbault expressed astonishment. I think\nthere's something utopian about this: it's so unlike the\nstand-offishness of New York life. Leverrier gave the name \"Vulcan\" to the object that Dr. Lescarbault had\nreported. By the same means by which he is, even to this day, supposed--by the\nfaithful--to have discovered Neptune, he had already announced the\nprobable existence of an Intra-Mercurial body, or group of bodies. He\nhad five observations besides Lescarbault's upon something that had been\nseen to cross the sun. In accordance with the mathematical hypnoses of\nhis era, he studied these six transits. Out of them he computed elements\ngiving \"Vulcan\" a period of about 20 days, or a formula for heliocentric\nlongitude at any time. But he placed the time of best observation away up in 1877. But even so, or considering that he still had probably a good many years\nto live, it may strike one that he was a little rash--that is if one has\nnot gone very deep into the study of hypnoses--that, having \"discovered\"\nNeptune by a method which, in our acceptance, had no more to recommend\nit than had once equally well-thought-of methods of witch-finding, he\nshould not have taken such chances: that if he was right as to Neptune,\nbut should be wrong as to \"Vulcan,\" his average would be away below that\nof most fortune-tellers, who could scarcely hope to do business upon a\nfifty per cent. basis--all that the reasoning of a tyro in hypnoses. The date:\n\nlate in the decade of the 1870s.",

The date:\n\nlate in the decade of the 1870s. The scientific world was up on its hind legs nosing the sky. The thing\nhad been done so authoritatively. Never a pope had said a thing with\nmore of the seeming of finality. If six observations correlated, what\nmore could be asked? The Editor of _Nature_, a week before the predicted\nevent, though cautious, said that it is difficult to explain how six\nobservers, unknown to one another, could have data that could be\nformulated, if they were not related phenomena. In a way, at this point occurs the crisis of our whole book. Formulas are against us. But can astronomic formulas, backed up by observations in agreement,\ntaken many years apart, calculated by a Leverrier, be as meaningless, in\na positive sense, as all other quasi-things that we have encountered so\nfar? The preparations they made, before late in the decade of the 1870s. In England, the\nAstronomer Royal made it the expectation of his life: notified observers\nat Madras, Melbourne, Sydney, and New Zealand, and arranged with\nobservers in Chili and the United States. M. Struve had prepared for\nobservations in Siberia and Japan--\n\nlate in the decade of the 1870s--\n\nNot absolutely, hypocritically, I think it's pathetic, myself. If anyone\nshould doubt the sincerity of Leverrier, in this matter, we note,\nwhether it has meaning or not, that a few months later he died. I think we'll take up Monstrator, though there's so much to this subject\nthat we'll have to come back. According to the _Annual Register_, 9-120, upon the 9th of August, 1762,\nM. de Rostan, of Basle, France, was taking altitudes of the sun, at\nLausanne. He saw a vast, spindle-shaped body, about three of the sun's\ndigits in breadth and nine in length, advancing slowly across the disk\nof the sun, or \"at no more than half the velocity with which the\nordinary solar spots move.\" It did not disappear until the 7th of\nSeptember, when it reached the sun's limb. Because of the spindle-like\nform, I incline to think of a super-Zeppelin, but another observation,\nwhich seems to indicate that it was a world, is that, though it was\nopaque, and \"eclipsed the sun,\" it had around it a kind of\nnebulosity--or atmosphere? A penumbra would ordinarily be a datum of a\nsun spot, but there are observations that indicate that this object was\nat a considerable distance from the sun:\n\nIt is recorded that another observer, at Paris, watching the sun, at\nthis time, had not seen this object:\n\nBut that M. Croste, at Sole, about forty-five German leagues northward\nfrom Lausanne, had seen it, describing the same spindle-form, but\ndisagreeing a little as to breadth. Then comes the important point: that\nhe and M. de Rostan did not see it upon the same part of the sun. This,\nthen, is parallax, and, compounded with invisibility at Paris, is great\nparallax--or that, in the course of a month, in the summer of 1762, a\nlarge, opaque, spindle-shaped body traversed the disk of the sun, but at\na great distance from the sun. The writer in the _Register_ says: \"In a\nword, we know of nothing to have recourse to, in the heavens, by which\nto explain this phenomenon.\" I suppose he was not a hopeless addict to\nexplaining. Extraordinary--we fear he must have been a man of loose\nhabits in some other respects. As to us--\n\nMonstrator. In the _Monthly Notices of the R.A.S._, February, 1877, Leverrier, who\nnever lost faith, up to the last day, gives the six observations upon an\nunknown body of planetary size, that he had formulated:\n\nFritsche, Oct. 10, 1802; Stark, Oct. 9, 1819; De Cuppis, Oct. 30, 1839;\nSidebotham, Nov. 12, 1849; Lescarbault, about 1850s; Lummis, about 1862. If we weren't so accustomed to Science in its essential aspect of\nDisregard, we'd be mystified and impressed, like the Editor of _Nature_,\nwith the formulation of these data: agreement of so many instances would\nseem incredible as a coincidence: but our acceptance is that, with just\nenough disregard, astronomers and fortune-tellers can formulate\nanything--or we'd engage, ourselves, to formulate periodicities in the\ncrowds in Broadway--say that every Wednesday morning, a tall man, with\none leg and a black eye, carrying a rubber plant, passes the Singer\nBuilding, at quarter past ten o'clock. Of course it couldn't really be\ndone, unless such a man did have such periodicity, but if some Wednesday\nmornings it should be a small child lugging a barrel, or a fat negress\nwith a week's wash, by ordinary disregard that would be prediction good\nenough for the kind of quasi-existence we're in.",

So whether we accuse, or whether we think that the word \"accuse\"\nover-dignifies an attitude toward a quasi-astronomer, or mere figment in\na super-dream, our acceptance is that Leverrier never did formulate\nobservations--\n\nThat he picked out observations that could be formulated--\n\nThat of this type are all formulas--\n\nThat, if Leverrier had not been himself helplessly hypnotized, or if he\nhad had in him more than a tincture of realness, never could he have\nbeen beguiled by such a quasi-process: but that he was hypnotized, and\nso extended, or transferred, his condition to others, that upon about 1877, he had this earth bristling with telescopes, with the rigid\nand almost inanimate forms of astronomers behind them--\n\nAnd not a blessed thing of any unusuality was seen upon that day or\nsucceeding days. But that the science of Astronomy suffered the slightest in prestige? It couldn't. The spirit of 1877 was behind it. If, in an embryo, some\ncells should not live up to the phenomena of their era, the others will\nsustain the scheduled appearances. Not until an embryo enters the\nmammalian stage are cells of the reptilian stage false cells. It is our acceptance that there were many equally authentic reports upon\nlarge planetary bodies that had been seen near the sun; that, of many,\nLeverrier picked out six; not then deciding that all the other\nobservations related to still other large, planetary bodies, but\narbitrarily, or hypnotically, disregarding--or heroically\ndisregarding--every one of them--that to formulate at all he had to\nexclude falsely. The d\u00e9nouement killed him, I think. I'm not at all\ninclined to place him with the Grays and Hitchcocks and Symonses. I'm\nnot, because, though it was rather unsportsmanlike to put the date so\nfar ahead, he did give a date, and he did stick to it with such a high\napproximation--\n\nI think Leverrier was translated to the Positive Absolute. The disregarded:\n\nObservation, of about 1819, by Gruthinson--but that was of two bodies\nthat crossed the sun together--\n\n_Nature_, 14-469:\n\nThat, according to the astronomer, J.R. Hind, Benjamin Scott, City\nChamberlain of London, and Mr. Wray, had, in 1847, seen a body similar\nto \"Vulcan\" cross the sun. Similar observation by Hind and Lowe, about 1840s (_L'Ann\u00e9e\nScientifique_, 1876-9). _Nature_, 14-505:\n\nBody of apparent size of Mercury, seen, Jan. 29, 1860, by F.A.R. Russell\nand four other observers, crossing the sun. De Vico's observation of about 1837 (_Observatory_, 2-424). _L'Ann\u00e9e Scientifique_, 1865-16:\n\nThat another amateur astronomer, M. Coumbray, of Constantinople, had\nwritten to Leverrier, that, upon the 8th of March, 1865, he had seen a\nblack point, sharply outlined, traverse the disk of the sun. It detached\nitself from a group of sun spots near the limb of the sun, and took 48\nminutes to reach the other limb. Figuring upon the diagram sent by M. Coumbray, a central passage would have taken a little more than an hour. This observation was disregarded by Leverrier, because his formula\nrequired about four times that velocity. The point here is that these\nother observations are as authentic as those that Leverrier included;\nthat, then, upon data as good as the data of \"Vulcan,\" there must be\nother \"Vulcans\"--the heroic and defiant disregard, then, of trying to\nformulate one, omitting the others, which, by orthodox doctrine, must\nhave influenced it greatly, if all were in the relatively narrow space\nbetween Mercury and the sun. Observation upon another such body, of about 1876, by M. Weber, of\nBerlin. As to this observation, Leverrier was informed by Wolf, in\nAugust, 1876 (_L'Ann\u00e9e Scientifique_, 1876-7). It made no difference, so\nfar as can be known, to this notable positivist. Two other observations noted by Hind and Denning--London _Times_, Nov. 3, 1871, and about 1873. _Monthly Notices of the R.A.S._, 20-100:\n\nStandacher, February, 1762; Lichtenberg, Nov. 19, 1762; Hoffman, May,\n1764; Dangos, Jan. 18, 1798; Stark, Feb. 12, 1820. An observation by\nSchmidt, Oct. 11, 1847, is said to be doubtful: but, upon page 192, it\nis said that this doubt had arisen because of a mistaken translation,\nand two other observations by Schmidt are given: Oct. 14, 1849, and Feb. 18, 1850--also an observation by Lofft, Jan. 6, 1818. Observation by\nSteinheibel, at Vienna, about 1820s (_Monthly Notices_, 1862). Haase had collected reports of twenty observations like Lescarbault's. The list was published in 1872, by Wolf.

We do not accuse the text-books of omitting this fiasco,\nbut we do note that theirs is the conventional adaptation here of all\nbeguilers who are in difficulties--\n\nThe diverting of attention. It wouldn't be possible in a real existence, with real mentality, to\ndeal with, but I suppose it's good enough for the quasi-intellects that\nstupefy themselves with text-books. The trick here is to gloss over\nLeverrier's mistake, and blame Lescarbault--he was only an amateur--had\ndelusions. The reader's attention is led against Lescarbault by a report\nfrom M. Lias, director of the Brazilian Coast Survey, who, at the time\nof Lescarbault's \"supposed\" observation had been watching the sun in\nBrazil, and, instead of seeing even ordinary sun spots, had noted that\nthe region of the \"supposed transit\" was of \"uniform intensity.\"\n\nBut the meaninglessness of all utterances in quasi-existence--\n\n\"Uniform intensity\" turns our way as much as against us--or some day\nsome brain will conceive a way of beating Newton's third law--if every\nreaction, or resistance, is, or can be, interpretable as stimulus\ninstead of resistance--if this could be done in mechanics, there's a way\nopen here for someone to own the world--specifically in this matter,\n\"uniform intensity\" means that Lescarbault saw no ordinary sun spot,\njust as much as it means that no spot at all was seen upon the sun. Continuing the interpretation of a resistance as an assistance, which\ncan always be done with mental forces--making us wonder what\napplications could be made with steam and electric forces--we point out\nthat invisibility in Brazil means parallax quite as truly as it means\nabsence, and, inasmuch as \"Vulcan\" was supposed to be distant from the\nsun, we interpret denial as corroboration--method of course of every\nscientist, politician, theologian, high-school debater. So the text-books, with no especial cleverness, because no especial\ncleverness is needed, lead the reader into contempt for the amateur of\nOrg\u00e8res, and forgetfulness of Leverrier--and some other subject is taken\nup. But our own acceptance:\n\nThat these data are as good as ever they were;\n\nThat, if someone of eminence should predict an earthquake, and if there\nshould be no earthquake at the predicted time, that would discredit the\nprophet, but data of past earthquakes would remain as good as ever they\nhad been. It is easy enough to smile at the illusion of a single\namateur--\n\nThe mass-formation:\n\nFritsche, Stark, De Cuppis, Sidebotham, Lescarbault, Lummis, Gruthinson,\nDe Vico, Scott, Wray, Russell, Hind, Lowe, Coumbray, Weber, Standacher,\nLichtenberg, Dangos, Hoffman, Schmidt, Lofft, Steinheibel, Pastorff--\n\nThese are only the observations conventionally listed relatively to an\nIntra-Mercurial planet. They are formidable enough to prevent our being\ndiverted, as if it were all the dream of a lonely amateur--but they're a\nmere advance-guard. From now on other data of large celestial bodies,\nsome dark and some reflecting light, will pass and pass and keep on\npassing--\n\nSo that some of us will remember a thing or two, after the procession's\nover--possibly. Taking up only one of the listed observations--\n\nOr our impression that the discrediting of Leverrier has nothing to do\nwith the acceptability of these data:\n\nIn the London _Times_, Jan. 10, 1860, is Benjamin Scott's account of his\nobservation:\n\nThat, in the summer of 1847, he had seen a body that had seemed to be\nthe size of Venus, crossing the sun. He says that, hardly believing the\nevidence of his sense of sight, he had looked for someone, whose hopes\nor ambitions would not make him so subject to illusion. He had told his\nlittle son, aged five years, to look through the telescope. The child\nhad exclaimed that he had seen \"a little balloon\" crossing the sun. Scott says that he had not had sufficient self-reliance to make public\nannouncement of his remarkable observation at the time, but that, in the\nevening of the same day, he had told Dr. Dick, F.R.A.S., who had cited\nother instances.

It's quite in accord with our general expression: not that there is an\nIntra-Mercurial planet, but that there are different bodies, many vast\nthings; near this earth sometimes, near the sun sometimes; orbitless\nworlds, which, because of scarcely any data of collisions, we think of\nas under navigable control--or dirigible super-constructions. Prof. Watson and Prof. Swift published their observations. Then the disregard that we cannot think of in terms of ordinary, sane\nexclusions. The text-book systematists begin by telling us that the trouble with\nthese observations is that they disagree widely: there is considerable\nrespectfulness, especially for Prof. Swift, but we are told that by\ncoincidence these two astronomers, hundreds of miles apart, were\nilluded: their observations were so different--\n\nProf. Swift (_Nature_, Sept. 19, 1878):\n\nThat his own observation was \"in close approximation to that given by\nProf. Watson.\"\n\nIn the _Observatory_, 2-161, Swift says that his observations and\nWatson's were \"confirmatory of each other.\"\n\nThe faithful try again:\n\nThat Watson and Swift mistook stars for other bodies. In the _Observatory_, 2-193, Prof. Watson says that he had previously\ncommitted to memory all stars near the sun, down to the seventh\nmagnitude--\n\nAnd he's damned anyway. How such exclusions work out is shown by Lockyer (_Nature_, Aug. 20,\n1878). He says: \"There is little doubt that an Intra-Mercurial planet\nhas been discovered by Prof. Watson.\"\n\nThat was before excommunication was pronounced. He says:\n\n\"If it will fit one of Leverrier's orbits\"--\n\nIt didn't fit. In _Nature_, 21-301, Prof. Swift says:\n\n\"I have never made a more valid observation, nor one more free from\ndoubt.\"\n\nHe's damned anyway. We shall have some data that will not live up to most rigorous\nrequirements, but, if anyone would like to read how carefully and\nminutely these two sets of observations were made, see Prof. Swift's\ndetailed description in the _Am. Jour. Sci._, 116-313; and the\ntechnicalities of Prof. Watson's observations in _Monthly Notices_,\n38-525. Our own acceptance upon dirigible worlds, which is assuredly enough,\nmore nearly real than attempted concepts of large planets relatively\nnear this earth, moving in orbits, but visible only occasionally; which\nmore nearly approximates to reasonableness than does wholesale slaughter\nof Swift and Watson and Fritsche and Stark and De Cuppis--but our own\nacceptance is so painful to so many minds that, in another of the\ncharitable moments that we have now and then for the sake of contrast,\nwe offer relief:\n\nThe things seen high in the sky by Swift and Watson--\n\nWell, only two months before--the horse and the barn--\n\nWe go on with more observations by astronomers, recognizing that it is\nthe very thing that has given them life, sustained them, held them\ntogether, that has crushed all but the quasi-gleam of independent life\nout of them. Were they not systematized, they could not be at all,\nexcept sporadically and without sustenance. They are systematized: they\nmust not vary from the conditions of the system: they must not break\naway for themselves. The two great commandments:\n\nThou shalt not break Continuity;\n\nThou shalt try. We go on with these disregarded data, some of which, many of which, are\nof the highest degree of acceptability. It is the System that pulls back\nits variations, as this earth is pulling back the Matterhorn. It is the\nSystem that nourishes and rewards, and also freezes out life with the\nchill of disregard. We do note that, before excommunication is\npronounced, orthodox journals do liberally enough record unassimilable\nobservations. All things merge away into everything else. That is Continuity.",

We do note that, before excommunication is\npronounced, orthodox journals do liberally enough record unassimilable\nobservations. All things merge away into everything else. That is Continuity. So the System merges away and evades us when we try to focus against it. We have complained a great deal. At least we are not so dull as to have\nthe delusion that we know just exactly what it is that we are\ncomplaining about. We speak seemingly definitely enough of \"the System,\"\nbut we're building upon observations by members of that very system. Or\nwhat we are doing--gathering up the loose heresies of the orthodox. Of\ncourse \"the System\" fringes and ravels away, having no real outline. A\nSwift will antagonize \"the System,\" and a Lockyer will call him back;\nbut, then, a Lockyer will vary with a \"meteoric hypothesis,\" and a Swift\nwill, in turn, represent \"the System.\" This state is to us typical of\nall intermediatist phenomena; or that not conceivably is anything\nreally anything, if its parts are likely to be their own opposites at\nany time. We speak of astronomers--as if there were real\nastronomers--but who have lost their identity in a System--as if it were\na real System--but behind that System is plainly a rapport, or loss of\nidentity in the Spirit of an Era. Bodies that have looked like dark bodies, and lights that may have been\nsunlight reflected from inter-planetary--objects, masses,\nconstructions--\n\nLights that have been seen upon--or near?--the moon:\n\nIn _Philosophical Transactions_, 82-27, is Herschel's report upon many\nluminous points, which he saw upon--or near?--the moon, during an\neclipse. Why they should be luminous, whereas the moon itself was dark,\nwould get us into a lot of trouble--except that later we shall, or we\nsha'n't, accept that many times have luminous objects been seen close to\nthis earth--at night. But numerousness is a new factor, or new disturbance, to our\nexplorations--\n\nA new aspect of inter-planetary inhabitancy or occupancy--\n\nWorlds in hordes--or beings--winged beings perhaps--wouldn't astonish me\nif we should end up by discovering angels--or beings in\nmachines--argosies of celestial voyagers--\n\nIn 1783 and 1787, Herschel reported more lights on or near the moon,\nwhich he supposed were volcanic. The word of a Herschel has had no more weight, in divergences from the\northodox, than has had the word of a Lescarbault. These observations are\nof the disregarded. Bright spots seen on the moon, November, 1821 (_Proc. London Roy. Soc._,\n2-167). For four other instances, see Loomis (_Treatise on Astronomy_, p. 174). A moving light is reported in _Phil. Trans._, 84-429. To the writer, it\nlooked like a star passing over the moon--\"which, on the next moment's\nconsideration I knew to be impossible.\" \"It was a fixed, steady light\nupon the dark part of the moon.\" I suppose \"fixed\" applies to luster. In the _Report of the Brit. Assoc._, 1847-18, there is an observation by\nRankin, upon luminous points seen on the shaded part of the moon,\nduring an eclipse. They seemed to this observer like reflections of\nstars. That's not very reasonable: however, we have, in the _Annual\nRegister_, 1821-687, a light not referable to a star--because it moved\nwith the moon: was seen three nights in succession; reported by Capt. Kater. See _Quart. Jour. Roy. Inst._, 12-133. _Phil. Trans._, 112-237:\n\nReport from the Cape Town Observatory: a whitish spot on the dark part\nof the moon's limb. Three smaller lights were seen. The call of positiveness, in its aspects of singleness, or homogeneity,\nor oneness, or completeness. In data now coming, I feel it myself. A\nLeverrier studies more than twenty observations. The inclination is\nirresistible to think that they all relate to one phenomenon. It is an\nexpression of cosmic inclination. Most of the observations are so\nirreconcilable with any acceptance other than of orbitless, dirigible\nworlds that he shuts his eyes to more than two-thirds of them; he picks\nout six that can give him the illusion of completeness, or of all\nrelating to one planet. Or let it be that we have data of many dark bodies--still do we incline\nalmost irresistibly to think of one of them as the dark-body-in-chief. Dark bodies, floating, or navigating, in inter-planetary space--and I\nconceive of one that's the Prince of Dark Bodies:\n\nMelanicus. Vast dark thing with the wings of a super-bat, or jet-black\nsuper-construction; most likely one of the spores of the Evil One. The extraordinary year, 1883:\n\nLondon _Times_, Dec. 17, 1883:\n\nExtract from a letter by Hicks Pashaw: that, in Egypt, Sept. 24, 1883,\nhe had seen, through glasses, \"an immense black spot upon the lower part\nof the sun.\"\n\nSun spot, maybe.

A dark object that was seen by Prof. Heis, for\neleven degrees of arc, moving slowly across the Milky Way. (Greg's\nCatalogue, _Rept. Brit. Assoc._, 1867-426.)\n\nOne of our quasi-reasons for accepting that orbitless worlds are\ndirigible is the almost complete absence of data of collisions: of\ncourse, though in defiance of gravitation, they may, without direction\nlike human direction, adjust to one another in the way of vortex rings\nof smoke--a very human-like way, that is. But in _Knowledge_, February,\n1894, are two photographs of Brooks' comet that are shown as evidence of\nits seeming collision with a dark object, October, 1893. Our own wording\nis that it \"struck against something\": Prof. Barnard's is that it had\n\"entered some dense medium, which shattered it.\" For all I know it had\nknocked against merely a field of ice. Melanicus. That upon the wings of a super-bat, he broods over this earth and over\nother worlds, perhaps deriving something from them: hovers on wings, or\nwing-like appendages, or planes that are hundreds of miles from tip to\ntip--a super-evil thing that is exploiting us. By Evil I mean that which\nmakes us useful. He obscures a star. He shoves a comet. I think he's a vast, black,\nbrooding vampire. _Science_, in the middle of the decade of the 1890s:\n\nThat, according to a newspaper account, Mr. W.R. Brooks, director of the\nSmith Observatory, had seen a dark round object pass rather slowly\nacross the moon, in a horizontal direction. In Mr. Brooks' opinion it\nwas a dark meteor. In _Science_, Sept. 14, 1896, a correspondent writes\nthat, in his opinion, it may have been a bird. We shall have no trouble\nwith the meteor and bird mergers, if we have observations of long\nduration and estimates of size up to hundreds of miles. As to the body\nthat was seen by Brooks, there is a note from the Dutch astronomer,\nMuller, in the _Scientific American_, 75-251, that, upon about 1892,\nhe had seen a similar phenomenon. In _Science Gossip_, n.s., 3-135, are\nmore details of the Brooks object--apparent diameter about one-thirtieth\nof the moon's--moon's disk crossed in three or four seconds. The writer,\nin _Science Gossip_, says that, on in the middle of the decade of the 1890s, at one o'clock in the\nmorning, he was looking at the moon with a 2-inch achromatic, power 44,\nwhen a long black object sailed past, from west to east, the transit\noccupying 3 or 4 seconds. He believed this object to be a bird--there\nwas, however, no fluttering motion observable in it. In the _Astronomische Nachrichten_, No. 3477, Dr. Brendel, of\nGriefswald, Pomerania, writes that Postmaster Ziegler and other\nobservers had seen a body about 6 feet in diameter crossing the sun's\ndisk. The duration here indicates something far from the earth, and also\nfar from the sun. This thing was seen a quarter of an hour before it\nreached the sun. Time in crossing the sun was about an hour. After\nleaving the sun it was visible an hour. I think he's a vast, black vampire that sometimes broods over this earth\nand other bodies. Communication from Dr. F.B. Harris (_Popular Astronomy_, 20-398):\n\nThat, upon the evening of Jan. 27, 1912, Dr. Harris saw, upon the moon,\n\"an intensely black object.\" He estimated it to be 250 miles long and 50\nmiles wide. \"The object resembled a crow poised, as near as anything.\"\nClouds then cut off observation. Dr. Harris writes:\n\n\"I cannot but think that a very interesting and curious phenomenon\nhappened.\"\n\n\nShort chapter coming now, and it's the worst of them all. I think it's\nspeculative. It's a lapse from our usual pseudo-standards. I think it\nmust mean that the preceding chapter was very efficiently done, and that\nnow by the rhythm of all quasi-things--which can't be real things, if\nthey're rhythms, because a rhythm is an appearance that turns into its\nown opposite and then back again--but now, to pay up, we're what we\nweren't. Short chapter, and I think we'll fill in with several points in\nIntermediatism. A puzzle:\n\nIf it is our acceptance that, out of the Negative Absolute, the Positive\nAbsolute is generating itself, recruiting, or maintaining, itself, via a\nthird state, or our own quasi-state, it would seem that we're trying to\nconceive of Universalness manufacturing more Universalness from\nNothingness. Take that up yourself, if you're willing to run the risk of\ndisappearing with such velocity that you'll leave an incandescent train\nbehind, and risk being infinitely happy forever, whereas you probably\ndon't want to be happy--I'll sidestep that myself, and try to be\nintelligible by regarding the Positive Absolute from the aspect of\nRealness instead of Universalness, recalling that by both Realness and\nUniversalness we mean the same state, or that which does not merge away\ninto something else, because there is nothing else.",

So the idea is that\nout of Unrealness, instead of Nothingness, Realness, instead of\nUniversalness, is, via our own quasi-state, manufacturing more Realness. Just so, but in relative terms, of course, all imaginings that\nmaterialize into machines or statues, buildings, dollars, paintings or\nbooks in paper and ink are graduations from unrealness to realness--in\nrelative terms. It would seem then that Intermediateness is a relation\nbetween the Positive Absolute and the Negative Absolute. But the\nabsolute cannot be the related--of course a confession that we can't\nreally think of it at all, if here we think of a limit to the unlimited. Doing the best we can, and encouraged by the reflection that we can't do\nworse than has been done by metaphysicians in the past, we accept that\nthe absolute can't be the related. So then that our quasi-state is not a\nreal relation, if nothing in it is real. On the other hand, it is not an\nunreal relation, if nothing in it is unreal. It seems thinkable that the\nPositive Absolute can, by means of Intermediateness, have a\nquasi-relation, or be only quasi-related, or be the unrelated, in final\nterms, or, at least, not be the related, in final terms. As to free will and Intermediatism--same answer as to everything else. By free will we mean Independence--or that which does not merge away\ninto something else--so, in Intermediateness, neither free-will nor\nslave-will--but a different approximation for every so-called person\ntoward one or the other of the extremes. The hackneyed way of expressing\nthis seems to me to be the acceptable way, if in Intermediateness,\nthere is only the paradoxical: that we're free to do what we have to do. I am not convinced that we make a fetish of the preposterous. I think\nour feeling is that in first gropings there's no knowing what will\nafterward be the acceptable. I think that if an early biologist heard of\nbirds that grow on trees, he should record that he had heard of birds\nthat grow on trees: then let sorting over of data occur afterward. The\none thing that we try to tone down but that is to a great degree\nunavoidable is having our data all mixed up like Long Island and Florida\nin the minds of early American explorers. My own notion is that this\nwhole book is very much like a map of North America in which the Hudson\nRiver is set down as a passage leading to Siberia. We think of\nMonstrator and Melanicus and of a world that is now in communication\nwith this earth: if so, secretly, with certain esoteric ones upon this\nearth. Whether that world's Monstrator and Monstrator's Melanicus--must\nbe the subject of later inquiry. It would be a gross thing to do: solve\nup everything now and leave nothing to our disciples. I have been very much struck with phenomena of \"cup marks.\"\n\nThey look to me like symbols of communication. But they do not look to me like means of communication between some of\nthe inhabitants of this earth and other inhabitants of this earth. My own impression is that some external force has marked, with symbols,\nrocks of this earth, from far away. I do not think that cup marks are inscribed communications among\ndifferent inhabitants of this earth, because it seems too unacceptable\nthat inhabitants of China, Scotland, and America should all have\nconceived of the same system. Cup marks are strings of cup-like impressions in rocks. Sometimes there\nare rings around them, and sometimes they have only semi-circles. Great\nBritain, America, France, Algeria, Circassia, Palestine: they're\nvirtually everywhere--except in the far north, I think. In China, cliffs\nare dotted with them.

Given that a force, say, like electric force, could, from a distance,\nmark such a substance as rocks, as, from a distance of hundreds of\nmiles, selenium can be marked by telephotographers--but I am of two\nminds--\n\nThe Lost Explorers from Somewhere, and an attempt, from Somewhere, to\ncommunicate with them: so a frenzy of showering of messages toward this\nearth, in the hope that some of them would mark rocks near the lost\nexplorers--\n\nOr that somewhere upon this earth, there is an especial rocky surface,\nor receptor, or polar construction, or a steep, conical hill, upon which\nfor ages have been received messages from some other world; but that at\ntimes messages go astray and mark substances perhaps thousands of miles\nfrom the receptor:\n\nThat perhaps forces behind the history of this earth have left upon the\nrocks of Palestine and England and India and China records that may some\nday be deciphered, of their misdirected instructions to certain esoteric\nones--Order of the Freemasons--the Jesuits--\n\nI emphasize the row-formation of cup marks:\n\nProf. Douglas (_Saturday Review_, Nov. 24, 1883):\n\n\"Whatever may have been their motive, the cup-markers showed a decided\nliking for arranging their sculpturings in regularly spaced rows.\"\n\nThat cup marks are an archaic form of inscription was first suggested by\nCanon Greenwell many years ago. But more specifically adumbratory to our\nown expression are the observations of Rivett-Carnac (_Jour. Roy. Asiatic Soc._, 1903-515):\n\nThat the Braille system of raised dots is an inverted arrangement of cup\nmarks: also that there are strong resemblances to the Morse code. But no\ntame and systematized archaeologist can do more than casually point out\nresemblances, and merely suggest that strings of cup marks look like\nmessages, because--China, Switzerland, Algeria, America--if messages\nthey be, there seems to be no escape from attributing one origin to\nthem--then, if messages they be, I accept one external origin, to which\nthe whole surface of this earth was accessible, for them. Something else that we emphasize:\n\nThat rows of cup marks have often been likened to footprints. But, in this similitude, their unilinear arrangement must be\ndisregarded--of course often they're mixed up in every way, but\narrangement in single lines is very common. It is odd that they should\nso often be likened to footprints: I suppose there are exceptional\ncases, but unless it's something that hops on one foot, or a cat going\nalong a narrow fence-top, I don't think of anything that makes\nfootprints one directly ahead of another--Cop, in a station house,\nwalking a chalk line, perhaps. Upon the Witch's Stone, near Ratho, Scotland, there are twenty-four\ncups, varying in size from one and a half to three inches in diameter,\narranged in approximately straight lines. Locally it is explained that\nthese are tracks of dogs' feet (_Proc. Soc. Antiq. Scotland_, 2-4-79). Similar marks are scattered bewilderingly all around the Witch's\nStone--like a frenzy of telegraphing, or like messages repeating and\nrepeating, trying to localize differently. In Inverness-shire, cup marks are called \"fairies' footmarks.\" At\nValna's church, Norway, and St. Peter's, Ambleteuse, there are such\nmarks, said to be horses' hoofprints. The rocks of Clare, Ireland, are\nmarked with prints supposed to have been made by a mythical cow\n(_Folklore_, 21-184). We now have such a ghost of a thing that I'd not like to be interpreted\nas offering it as a datum: it simply illustrates what I mean by the\nnotion of symbols, like cups, or like footprints, which, if like those\nof horses or cows, are the reverse of, or the negatives of, cups--of\nsymbols that are regularly received somewhere upon this earth--steep,\nconical hill, somewhere, I think--but that have often alighted in wrong\nplaces--considerably to the mystification of persons waking up some\nmorning to find them upon formerly blank spaces. An ancient record--still worse, an ancient Chinese record--of a\ncourtyard of a palace--dwellers of the palace waking up one morning,\nfinding the courtyard marked with tracks like the footprints of an\nox--supposed that the devil did it. (_Notes and Queries_, 9-6-225.)\n\n16. Angels. Hordes upon hordes of them. Beings massed like the clouds of souls, or the commingling whiffs of\nspirituality, or the exhalations of souls that Dor\u00e9 pictured so often. It may be that the Milky Way is a composition of stiff, frozen,\nfinally-static, absolute angels. We shall have data of little Milky\nWays, moving swiftly; or data of hosts of angels, not absolute, or still\ndynamic. I suspect, myself, that the fixed stars are really fixed, and\nthat the minute motions said to have been detected in them are\nillusions. I think that the fixed stars are absolutes. Their twinkling\nis only the interpretation by an intermediatist state of them. I think\nthat soon after Leverrier died, a new fixed star was discovered--that,\nif Dr.",

I think\nthat soon after Leverrier died, a new fixed star was discovered--that,\nif Dr. Gray had stuck to his story of the thousands of fishes from one\npail of water, had written upon it, lectured upon it, taken to street\ncorners, to convince the world that, whether conceivable or not, his\nexplanation was the only true explanation: had thought of nothing but\nthis last thing at night and first thing in the morning--his\nobituary--another \"nova\" reported in _Monthly Notices_. I think that Milky Ways, of an inferior, or dynamic, order, have often\nbeen seen by astronomers. Of course it may be that the phenomena that we\nshall now consider are not angels at all. We are simply feeling around,\ntrying to find out what we can accept. Some of our data indicate hosts\nof rotund and complacent tourists in inter-planetary space--but then\ndata of long, lean, hungry ones. I think that there are, out in\ninter-planetary space, Super Tamerlanes at the head of hosts of\ncelestial ravagers--which have come here and pounced upon civilizations\nof the past, cleaning them up all but their bones, or temples and\nmonuments--for which later historians have invented exclusionist\nhistories. But if something now has a legal right to us, and can\nenforce its proprietorship, they've been warned off. It's the way of all\nexploitation. I should say that we're now under cultivation: that we're\nconscious of it, but have the impertinence to attribute it all to our\nown nobler and higher instincts. Against these notions is the same sense of finality that opposes all\nadvance. It's why we rate acceptance as a better adaptation than belief. Opposing us is the strong belief that, as to inter-planetary phenomena,\nvirtually everything has been found out. Sense of finality and illusion\nof homogeneity. But that what is called advancing knowledge is violation\nof the sense of blankness. A drop of water. Once upon a time water was considered so homogeneous\nthat it was thought of as an element. The microscope--and not only that\nthe supposititiously elementary was seen to be of infinite diversity,\nbut that in its protoplasmic life there were new orders of beings. Or the year 1491--and a European looking westward over the ocean--his\nfeeling that that suave western droop was unbreakable; that gods of\nregularity would not permit that smooth horizon to be disturbed by\ncoasts or spotted with islands. The unpleasantness of even contemplating\nsuch a state--wide, smooth west, so clean against the sky--spotted with\nislands--geographic leprosy. But coasts and islands and Indians and bison, in the seemingly vacant\nwest: lakes, mountains, rivers--\n\nOne looks up at the sky: the relative homogeneity of the\nrelatively unexplored: one thinks of only a few kinds of phenomena. But the acceptance is forced upon me that there are modes and modes\nand modes of inter-planetary existence: things as different from\nplanets and comets and meteors as Indians are from bison and prairie\ndogs: a super-geography--or celestiography--of vast stagnant regions,\nbut also of Super-Niagaras and Ultra-Mississippis: and a\nsuper-sociology--voyagers and tourists and ravagers: the hunted and the\nhunting: the super-mercantile, the super-piratic, the super-evangelical. Sense of homogeneity, or our positivist illusion of the unknown--and the\nfate of all positivism. Astronomy and the academic. Ethics and the abstract. The universal attempt to formulate or to regularize--an attempt that can\nbe made only by disregarding or denying. Or all things disregard or deny that which will eventually invade and\ndestroy them--\n\nUntil comes the day when some one thing shall say, and enforce upon\nInfinitude:\n\n\"Thus far shalt thou go: here is absolute demarcation.\"\n\nThe final utterance:\n\n\"There is only I.\"\n\nIn the _Monthly Notices of the R.A.S._, 11-48, there is a letter from\nthe Rev. W. Read:\n\nThat, upon the 4th of September, 1851, at 9:30 A.M., he had seen a host\nof self-luminous bodies, passing the field of his telescope, some slowly\nand some rapidly. They appeared to occupy a zone several degrees in\nbreadth. The direction of most of them was due east to west, but some\nmoved from north to south. The numbers were tremendous. They were\nobserved for six hours. Editor's note:\n\n\"May not these appearances be attributed to an abnormal state of the\noptic nerves of the observer?\"\n\nIn _Monthly Notices_, 12-38, Mr. Read answers that he had been a\ndiligent observer, with instruments of a superior order, for about 28\nyears--\"but I have never witnessed such an appearance before.\" As to\nillusion he says that two other members of his family had seen the\nobjects. The Editor withdraws his suggestion. We know what to expect. Almost absolutely--in an existence that is\nessentially Hibernian--we can predict the past--that is, look over\nsomething of this kind, written in 1851, and know what to expect from\nthe Exclusionists later. If Mr. Read saw a migration of dissatisfied\nangels, numbering millions, they must merge away, at least subjectively,\nwith commonplace terrestrial phenomena--of course disregarding Mr. Read's probable familiarity, of 28 years' duration, with the\ncommonplaces of terrestrial phenomena. _Monthly Notices_, 12-183:\n\nLetter from Rev.

W.R. Dawes:\n\nThat he had seen similar objects--and in the month of September--that\nthey were nothing but seeds floating in the air. In the _Report of the British Association_, 1852-235, there is a\ncommunication from Mr. Read to Prof. Baden-Powell:\n\nThat the objects that had been seen by him and by Mr. Dawes were not\nsimilar. He denies that he had seen seeds floating in the air. There had\nbeen little wind, and that had come from the sea, where seeds would not\nbe likely to have origin. The objects that he had seen were round and\nsharply defined, and with none of the feathery appearance of\nthistledown. He then quotes from a letter from C.B. Chalmers, F.R.A.S.,\nwho had seen a similar stream, a procession, or migration, except that\nsome of the bodies were more elongated--or lean and hungry--than\nglobular. He might have argued for sixty-five years. He'd have impressed\nnobody--of importance. The super-motif, or dominant, of his era, was\nExclusionism, and the notion of seeds in the air assimilates--with due\ndisregards--with that dominant. Or pageantries here upon our earth, and things looking down upon us--and\nthe Crusades were only dust clouds, and glints of the sun on shining\narmor were only particles of mica in dust clouds. I think it was a\nCrusade that Read saw--but that it was right, relatively to the year\n1851, to say that it was only seeds in the wind, whether the wind blew\nfrom the sea or not. I think of things that were luminous with religious\nzeal, mixed up, like everything else in Intermediateness, with black\nmarauders and from gray to brown beings of little personal ambitions. There may have been a Richard Coeur de Lion, on his way to right\nwrongs in Jupiter. It was right, relatively to 1851, to say that he was\na seed of a cabbage. Prof. Coffin, U.S.N. (_Jour. Frank. Inst._, 88-151):\n\nThat, during the eclipse of August, 1869, he had noted the passage,\nacross his telescope, of several bright flakes resembling thistleblows,\nfloating in the sunlight. But the telescope was so focused that, if\nthese things were distinct, they must have been so far away from this\nearth that the difficulties of orthodoxy remain as great, one way or\nanother, no matter what we think they were--\n\nThey were \"well-defined,\" says Prof. Coffin. Henry Waldner (_Nature_, 5-304):\n\nThat, about 1863, he had seen great numbers of small, shining bodies\npassing from west to east. He had notified Dr. Wolf, of the Observatory\nof Zurich, who \"had convinced himself of this strange phenomenon.\" Dr. Wolf had told him that similar bodies had been seen by Sig. Capocci, of\nthe Capodimonte Observatory, at Naples, about 1845. The shapes were of great diversity--or different aspects of similar\nshapes? Appendages were seen upon some of them. We are told that some were star-shaped, with transparent appendages. I think, myself, it was a Mohammed and his Hegira. May have been only\nhis harem. Astonishing sensation: afloat in space with ten million wives\naround one. Anyway, it would seem that we have considerable advantage\nhere, inasmuch as seeds are not in season in April--but the pulling back\nto earth, the bedraggling by those sincere but dull ones of some time\nago. We have the same stupidity--necessary, functioning stupidity--of\nattribution of something that was so rare that an astronomer notes only\none instance between 1845 and 1863, to an every-day occurrence--\n\nOr Mr. Waldner's assimilative opinion that he had seen only ice\ncrystals. Whether they were not very exclusive veils of a super-harem, or planes\nof a very light material, we have an impression of star-shaped things\nwith transparent appendages that have been seen in the sky.

Of course, at a distance, any form is likely to look round or roundish:\nbut we point out that we have notes upon the seeming of more complex\nforms. In _L'Astronomie_, 1886-70, is recorded M. Briguiere's\nobservation, at Marseilles, April 15 and about 1883, upon the\ncrossing of the sun by bodies that were irregular in form. Some of them\nmoved as if in alignment. Letter from Sir Robert Inglis to Col. Sabine (_Rept. Brit. Assoc._,\n1849-17):\n\nThat, at 3 P.M., Aug. 8, 1849, at Gais, Switzerland, Inglis had seen\nthousands and thousands of brilliant white objects, like snowflakes in a\ncloudless sky. Though this display lasted about twenty-five minutes, not\none of these seeming snowflakes was seen to fall. Inglis says that his\nservant \"fancied\" that he had seen something like wings on\nthese--whatever they were. Upon page 18, of the _Report_, Sir John\nHerschel says that, in 1845 or 1846, his attention had been attracted by\nobjects of considerable size, in the air, seemingly not far away. He had\nlooked at them through a telescope. He says that they were masses of\nhay, not less than a yard or two in diameter. Still there are some\ncircumstances that interest me. He says that, though no less than a\nwhirlwind could have sustained these masses, the air about him was calm. \"No doubt wind prevailed at the spot, but there was no roaring noise.\"\nNone of these masses fell within his observation or knowledge. To walk a\nfew fields away and find out more would seem not much to expect from a\nman of science, but it is one of our superstitions, that such a seeming\ntrifle is just what--by the Spirit of an Era, we'll call it--one is not\npermitted to do. If those things were not masses of hay, and if Herschel\nhad walked a little and found out, and had reported that he had seen\nstrange objects in the air--that report, in 1846, would have been as\nmisplaced as the appearance of a tail upon an embryo still in its\ngastrula era. I have noticed this inhibition in my own case many times. Looking back--why didn't I do this or that little thing that would have\ncost so little and have meant so much? Didn't belong to that era of my\nown development. _Nature_, 22-64:\n\nThat, at Kattenau, Germany, about half an hour before sunrise, about 1880, \"an enormous number of luminous bodies rose from the horizon, and\npassed in a horizontal direction from east to west.\" They are described\nas having appeared in a zone or belt. \"They shone with a remarkably\nbrilliant light.\"\n\nSo they've thrown lassos over our data to bring them back to earth. But\nthey're lassos that cannot tighten. We can't pull out of them: we may\nstep out of them, or lift them off. Some of us used to have an\nimpression of Science sitting in calm, just judgment: some of us now\nfeel that a good many of our data have been lynched. If a Crusade,\nperhaps from Mars to Jupiter, occur in the autumn--\"seeds.\" If a Crusade\nor outpouring of celestial vandals is seen from this earth in the\nspring--\"ice crystals.\" If we have record of a race of aerial beings,\nperhaps with no substantial habitat, seen by someone in\nIndia--\"locusts.\"\n\nThis will be disregarded:\n\nIf locusts fly high, they freeze and fall in thousands. _Nature_, 47-581:\n\nLocusts that were seen in the mountains of India, at a height of 12,750\nfeet--\"in swarms and dying by thousands.\"\n\nBut no matter whether they fly high or fly low, no one ever wonders\nwhat's in the air when locusts are passing overhead, because of the\nfalling of stragglers. I have especially looked this matter up--no\nmystery when locusts are flying overhead--constant falling of\nstragglers. _Monthly Notices_, 30-135:\n\n\"An unusual phenomenon noticed by Lieut. Herschel, Oct. 17 and 18, 1870,\nwhile observing the sun, at Bangalore, India.\"\n\nLieut. Herschel had noticed dark shadows crossing the sun--but away from\nthe sun there were luminous, moving images. For two days bodies passed\nin a continuous stream, varying in size and velocity. The Lieutenant tries to explain, as we shall see, but he says:\n\n\"As it was, the continuous flight, for two whole days, in such numbers,\nin the upper regions of the air, of beasts that left no stragglers, is a\nwonder of natural history, if not of astronomy.\"\n\nHe tried different focusing--he saw wings--perhaps he saw planes. He\nsays that he saw upon the objects either wings or phantom-like\nappendages. Then he saw something that was so bizarre that, in the fullness of his\nnineteenth-centuriness, he writes:\n\n\"There was no longer doubt: they were locusts or flies of some sort.\"\n\nOne of them had paused.

The Editor says that at that time \"countless locusts had descended upon\ncertain parts of India.\"\n\nWe now have an instance that is extraordinary in several\nrespects--super-voyagers or super-ravagers; angels, ragamuffins,\ncrusaders, emigrants, aeronauts, or aerial elephants, or bison or\ndinosaurs--except that I think the thing had planes or wings--one of\nthem has been photographed. It may be that in the history of photography\nno more extraordinary picture than this has ever been taken. _L'Astronomie_, 1885-347:\n\nThat, at the Observatory of Zacatecas, Mexico, Aug. 12, 1883, about\n2,500 meters above sea level, were seen a large number of small luminous\nbodies, entering upon the disk of the sun. M. Bonilla telegraphed to the\nObservatories of the City of Mexico and of Puebla. Word came back that\nthe bodies were not visible there. Because of this parallax, M. Bonilla\nplaced the bodies \"relatively near the earth.\" But when we find out what\nhe called \"relatively near the earth\"--birds or bugs or hosts of a\nSuper-Tamerlane or army of a celestial Richard Coeur de Lion--our\nheresies rejoice anyway. His estimate is \"less distance than the moon.\"\n\nOne of them was photographed. See _L'Astronomie_, 1885-349. The\nphotograph shows a long body surrounded by indefinite structures, or by\nthe haze of wings or planes in motion. _L'Astronomie_, 1887-66;\n\nSigner Ricco, of the Observatory of Palermo, writes that, Nov. 30, 1880,\nat 8:30 o'clock in the morning, he was watching the sun, when he saw,\nslowly traversing its disk, bodies in two long, parallel lines, and a\nshorter, parallel line. The bodies looked winged to him. But so large\nwere they that he had to think of large birds. He thought of cranes. He consulted ornithologists, and learned that the configuration of\nparallel lines agrees with the flight-formation of cranes. This was in\n1880: anybody now living in New York City, for instance, would tell him\nthat also it is a familiar formation of aeroplanes. But, because of data\nof focus and subtended angles, these beings or objects must have been\nhigh. Sig. Ricco argues that condors have been known to fly three or four\nmiles high, and that heights reached by other birds have been estimated\nat two or three miles. He says that cranes have been known to fly so\nhigh that they have been lost to view. Our own acceptance, in conventional terms, is that there is not a bird\nof this earth that would not freeze to death at a height of more than\nfour miles: that if condors fly three or four miles high, they are birds\nthat are especially adapted to such altitudes. Sig. Ricco's estimate is that these objects or beings or cranes must\nhave been at least five and a half miles high. The vast dark thing that looked like a poised crow of unholy dimensions. Assuming that I shall ever have any readers, let him, or both of them,\nif I shall ever have such popularity as that, note how dim that bold\nblack datum is at the distance of only two chapters. The question:\n\nWas it a thing or the shadow of a thing? Acceptance either way calls not for mere revision but revolution in the\nscience of astronomy. But the dimness of the datum of only two chapters\nago. The carved stone disk of Tarbes, and the rain that fell every\nafternoon for twenty--if I haven't forgotten, myself, whether it was\ntwenty-three or twenty-five days!--upon one small area. We are all\nThomsons, with brains that have smooth and slippery, though corrugated,\nsurfaces--or that all intellection is associative--or that we remember\nthat which correlates with a dominant--and a few chapters go by, and\nthere's scarcely an impression that hasn't slid off our smooth and\nslippery brains, of Leverrier and the \"planet Vulcan.\" There are two\nways by which irreconcilables can be remembered--if they can be\ncorrelated in a system more nearly real than the system that rejects\nthem--and by repetition and repetition and repetition. Vast black thing like a crow poised over the moon. The datum is so important to us, because it enforces, in another field,\nour acceptance that dark bodies of planetary size traverse this solar\nsystem. Our position:\n\nThat the things have been seen:\n\nAlso that their shadows have been seen. Vast black thing poised like a crow over the moon. So far it is a single\ninstance. By a single instance, we mean the negligible. In _Popular Science_, 34-158, Serviss tells of a shadow that Schroeter\nsaw, in 1788, in the lunar Alps. First he saw a light. But then, when\nthis region was illuminated, he saw a round shadow where the light had\nbeen. Our own expression:\n\nThat he saw a luminous object near the moon: that that part of the moon\nbecame illuminated, and the object was lost to view; but that then its\nshadow underneath was seen. Serviss explains, of course.",

Our own expression:\n\nThat he saw a luminous object near the moon: that that part of the moon\nbecame illuminated, and the object was lost to view; but that then its\nshadow underneath was seen. Serviss explains, of course. Otherwise he'd not be Prof. Serviss. It's a\nlittle contest in relative approximations to realness. Prof. Serviss\nthinks that what Schroeter saw was the \"round\" shadow of a mountain--in\nthe region that had become lighted. He assumes that Schroeter never\nlooked again to see whether the shadow could be attributed to a\nmountain. That's the crux: conceivably a mountain could cast a\nround--and that means detached--shadow, in the lighted part of the moon. Prof. Serviss could, of course, explain why he disregards the light in\nthe first place--maybe it had always been there \"in the first place.\" If\nhe couldn't explain, he'd still be an amateur. We have another datum. I think it is more extraordinary than--\n\nVast thing, black and poised, like a crow, over the moon. But only because it's more circumstantial, and because it has\ncorroboration, do I think it more extraordinary than--\n\nVast poised thing, black as a crow, over the moon. Mr. H.C. Russell, who was usually as orthodox as anybody, I suppose--at\nleast, he wrote \"F.R.A.S.\" after his name--tells in the _Observatory_,\n2-374, one of the wickedest, or most preposterous, stories that we have\nso far exhumed:\n\nThat he and another astronomer, G.D. Hirst, were in the Blue fountains,\nnear Sydney, N.S.W., and Mr. Hirst was looking at the moon--\n\nHe saw on the moon what Russell calls \"one of those remarkable facts,\nwhich being seen should be recorded, although no explanation can at\npresent be offered.\"\n\nThat may be so. It is very rarely done. Our own expression upon\nevolution by successive dominants and their correlates is against it. On\nthe other hand, we express that every era records a few observations out\nof harmony with it, but adumbratory or preparatory to the spirit of\neras still to come. It's very rarely done. Lashed by the phantom-scourge\nof a now passing era, the world of astronomers is in a state of\nterrorism, though of a highly attenuated, modernized, devitalized kind. Let an astronomer see something that is not of the conventional,\ncelestial sights, or something that it is \"improper\" to see--his very\ndignity is in danger. Some one of the corralled and scourged may stick a\nsmile into his back. He'll be thought of unkindly. With a hardihood that is unusual in his world of ethereal\nsensitivenesses, Russell says, of Hirst's observation:\n\n\"He found a large part of it covered with a dark shade, quite as dark as\nthe shadow of the earth during an eclipse of the moon.\"\n\nBut the climax of hardihood or impropriety or wickedness,\npreposterousness or enlightenment:\n\n\"One could hardly resist the conviction that it was a shadow, yet it\ncould not be the shadow of any known body.\"\n\nRichard Proctor was a man of some liberality. After a while we shall\nhave a letter, which once upon a time we'd have called delirious--don't\nknow that we could read such a thing now, for the first time, without\nincredulous laughter--which Mr. Proctor permitted to be published in\n_Knowledge_. But a dark, unknown world that could cast a shadow upon a\nlarge part of the moon, perhaps extending far beyond the limb of the\nmoon; a shadow as deep as the shadow of this earth--\n\nToo much for Mr. Proctor's politeness. I haven't read what he said, but it seems to have been a little coarse. Russell says that Proctor \"freely used\" his name in the _Echo_, of about 1870s, ridiculing this observation which had been made by Russell as\nwell as Hirst. If it hadn't been Proctor, it would have been someone\nelse--but one notes that the attack came out in a newspaper. There is no\ndiscussion of this remarkable subject, no mention in any other\nastronomic journal.

One indignation quoted from Proctor interests us:\n\n\"What happens on the moon may at any time happen to this earth.\"\n\nOr:\n\nThat is just the teaching of this department of Advanced Astronomy:\n\nThat Russell and Hirst saw the sun eclipsed relatively to the moon by a\nvast dark body:\n\nThat many times have eclipses occurred relatively to this earth, by\nvast, dark bodies:\n\nThat there have been many eclipses that have not been recognized as\neclipses by scientific kindergartens. There is a merger, of course. We'll take a look at it first--that, after\nall, it may have been a shadow that Hirst and Russell saw, but the only\nsignificance is that the sun was eclipsed relatively to the moon by a\ncosmic haze of some kind, or a swarm of meteors close together, or a\ngaseous discharge left behind by a comet. My own acceptance is that\nvagueness of shadow is a function of vagueness of intervention; that a\nshadow as dense as the shadow of this earth is cast by a body denser\nthan hazes and swarms. The information seems definite enough in this\nrespect--\"quite as dark as the shadow of this earth during the eclipse\nof the moon.\"\n\nThough we may not always be as patient toward them as we should be, it\nis our acceptance that the astronomic primitives have done a great deal\nof good work: for instance, in the allaying of fears upon this earth. Sometimes it may seem as if all science were to us very much like what a\nred flag is to bulls and anti-socialists. It's not that: it's more like\nwhat unsquare meals are to bulls and anti-socialists--not the\nscientific, but the insufficient. Our acceptance is that Evil is the\nnegative state, by which we mean the state of maladjustment, discord,\nugliness, disorganization, inconsistency, injustice, and so on--as\ndetermined in Intermediateness, not by real standards, but only by\nhigher approximations to adjustment, harmony, beauty, organization,\nconsistency, justice, and so on. Evil is outlived virtue, or incipient\nvirtue that has not yet established itself, or any other phenomenon that\nis not in seeming adjustment, harmony, consistency with a dominant. The\nastronomers have functioned bravely in the past. They've been good for\nbusiness: the big interests think kindly, if at all, of them. It's bad\nfor trade to have an intense darkness come upon an unaware community and\nfrighten people out of their purchasing values. But if an obscuration be\nforetold, and if it then occur--may seem a little uncanny--only a\nshadow--and no one who was about to buy a pair of shoes runs home\npanic-stricken and saves the money. Upon general principles we accept that astronomers have\nquasi-systematized data of eclipses--or have included some and\ndisregarded others. They have done well. They have functioned. But now they're negatives, or they're out of harmony--\n\nIf we are in harmony with a new dominant, or the spirit of a new era, in\nwhich Exclusionism must be overthrown; if we have data of many\nobscurations that have occurred, not only upon the moon, but upon our\nown earth, as convincing of vast intervening bodies, usually invisible,\nas is any regularized, predicted eclipse. One looks up at the sky. It seems incredible that, say, at the distance of the moon, there could\nbe, but be invisible, a solid body, say, the size of the moon. One looks up at the moon, at a time when only a crescent of it is\nvisible. The tendency is to build up the rest of it in one's mind; but\nthe unillumined part looks as vacant as the rest of the sky, and it's of\nthe same blueness as the rest of the sky. There's a vast area of solid\nsubstance before one's eyes. It's indistinguishable from the sky. In some of our little lessons upon the beauties of modesty and humility,\nwe have picked out basic arrogances--tail of a peacock, horns of a stag,\ndollars of a capitalist--eclipses of astronomers. Though I have no\ndesire for the job, I'd engage to list hundreds of instances in which\nthe report upon an expected eclipse has been \"sky overcast\" or \"weather\nunfavorable.\" In our Super-Hibernia, the unfavorable has been construed\nas the favorable. Some time ago, when we were lost, because we had not\nrecognized our own dominant, when we were still of the unchosen and\nlikely to be more malicious than we now are--because we have noted a\nsteady tolerance creeping into our attitude--if astronomers are not to\nblame, but are only correlates to a dominant--we advertised a predicted\neclipse that did not occur at all.

Now, without any especial feeling,\nexcept that of recognition of the fate of all attempted absolutism, we\ngive the instance, noting that, though such an evil thing to orthodoxy,\nit was orthodoxy that recorded the non-event. _Monthly Notices of the R.A.S._, 8-132:\n\n\"Remarkable appearances during the total eclipse of the moon on late in the decade of the 1840s\":\n\nIn an extract from a letter from Mr. Forster, of Bruges, it is said\nthat, according to the writer's observations at the time of the\npredicted total eclipse, the moon shone with about three times the\nintensity of the mean illumination of an eclipsed lunar disk: that the\nBritish Consul, at Ghent, who did not know of the predicted eclipse, had\nwritten enquiring as to the \"blood-red\" color of the moon. This is not very satisfactory to what used to be our malices. But\nthere follows another letter, from another astronomer, Walkey, who\nhad made observations at Clyst St. Lawrence: that, instead of an\neclipse, the moon became--as is printed in italics--\"most beautifully\nilluminated\" ... \"rather tinged with a deep red\"... \"the moon being\nas perfect with light as if there had been no eclipse whatever.\"\n\nI note that Chambers, in his work upon eclipses, gives Forster's letter\nin full--and not a mention of Walkey's letter. There is no attempt in _Monthly Notices_ to explain upon the notion of\ngreater distance of the moon, and the earth's shadow falling short,\nwhich would make as much trouble for astronomers, if that were not\nforeseen, as no eclipse at all. Also there is no refuge in saying that\nvirtually never, even in total eclipses, is the moon totally dark--\"as\nperfect with light as if there had been no eclipse whatever.\" It is said\nthat at the time there had been an aurora borealis, which might have\ncaused the luminosity, without a datum that such an effect, by an\naurora, had ever been observed upon the moon. But single instances--so an observation by Scott, in the Antarctic. The\nforce of this datum lies in my own acceptance, based upon especially\nlooking up this point, that an eclipse nine-tenths of totality has great\neffect, even though the sky be clouded. Scott (_Voyage of the Discovery_, vol. ii, p. 215):\n\n\"There may have been an eclipse of the sun, Sept. 21, 1903, as the\nalmanac said, but we should, none of us, have liked to swear to the\nfact.\"\n\nThis eclipse had been set down at nine-tenths of totality. The sky was\novercast at the time. So it is not only that many eclipses unrecognized by astronomers as\neclipses have occurred, but that intermediatism, or impositivism, breaks\ninto their own seemingly regularized eclipses. Our data of unregularized eclipses, as profound as those that are\nconventionally--or officially?--recognized, that have occurred\nrelatively to this earth:\n\nIn _Notes and Queries_ there are several allusions to intense darknesses\nthat have occurred upon this earth, quite as eclipses occur, but that\nare not referable to any known eclipsing body. Of course there is no\nsuggestion here that these darknesses may have been eclipses. My own\nacceptance is that if in the nineteenth century anyone had uttered such\na thought as that, he'd have felt the blight of a Dominant; that\nMaterialistic Science was a jealous god, excluding, as works of the\ndevil, all utterances against the seemingly uniform, regular, periodic;\nthat to defy him would have brought on--withering by ridicule--shrinking\naway by publishers--contempt of friends and family--justifiable grounds\nfor divorce--that one who would so defy would feel what unbelievers in\nrelics of saints felt in an earlier age; what befell virgins who forgot\nto keep fires burning, in a still earlier age--but that, if he'd almost\nabsolutely hold out, just the same--new fixed star reported in _Monthly\nNotices_. Altogether, the point in Positivism here is that by Dominants\nand their correlates, quasi-existence strives for the positive state,\naggregating, around a nucleus, or dominant, systematized members of a\nreligion, a science, a society--but that \"individuals\" who do not\nsurrender and submerge may of themselves highly approximate to\npositiveness--the fixed, the real, the absolute. In _Notes and Queries_, 2-4-139, there is an account of a darkness in\nHolland, in the midst of a bright day, so intense and terrifying that\nmany panic-stricken persons lost their lives stumbling into the canals. _Gentleman's Magazine_, 33-414:\n\nA darkness that came upon London, Aug. 19, 1763, \"greater than at the\ngreat eclipse of 1748.\"\n\nHowever, our preference is not to go so far back for data. For a list of\nhistoric \"dark days,\" see Humboldt, _Cosmos_, 1-120. _Monthly Weather Review_, March, 1886-79:\n\nThat, according to the _La Crosse Daily Republican_, of in the middle of the decade of the 1880s,\ndarkness suddenly settled upon the city of Oshkosh, Wis., at 3 P.M.,\nMarch 19. In five minutes the darkness equaled that of midnight. Consternation. I think that some of us are likely to overdo our own superiority and the\nabsurd fears of the Middle Ages--\n\nOshkosh.",

In five minutes the darkness equaled that of midnight. Consternation. I think that some of us are likely to overdo our own superiority and the\nabsurd fears of the Middle Ages--\n\nOshkosh. People in the streets rushing in all directions--horses running\naway--women and children running into cellars--little modern touch after\nall: gas meters instead of images and relics of saints. This darkness, which lasted from eight to ten minutes, occurred in a day\nthat had been \"light but cloudy.\" It passed from west to east, and\nbrightness followed: then came reports from towns to the west of\nOshkosh: that the same phenomenon had already occurred there. A \"wave of\ntotal darkness\" had passed from west to east. Other instances are recorded in the _Monthly Weather Review_, but, as to\nall of them, we have a sense of being pretty well-eclipsed, ourselves,\nby the conventional explanation that the obscuring body was only a very\ndense mass of clouds. But some of the instances are interesting--intense\ndarkness at Memphis, Tenn., for about fifteen minutes, at 10 A.M., Dec. 2, 1904--\"We are told that in some quarters a panic prevailed, and that\nsome were shouting and praying and imagining that the end of the world\nhad come.\" (_M.W.R._, 32-522.) At Louisville, Ky., early in the decade of the 1910s, at\nabout 8 A.M.: duration about half an hour; had been raining moderately,\nand then hail had fallen. \"The intense blackness and general ominous\nappearance of the storm spread terror throughout the city.\" (_M.W.R._,\n39-345.)\n\nHowever, this merger between possible eclipses by unknown dark bodies\nand commonplace terrestrial phenomena is formidable. As to darknesses that have fallen upon vast areas, conventionality\nis--smoke from forest fires. In the _U.S. Forest Service Bulletin_, No. 117, F.G. Plummer gives a list of eighteen darknesses that have occurred\nin the United States and Canada. He is one of the primitives, but I\nshould say that his dogmatism is shaken by vibrations from the new\nDominant. His difficulty, which he acknowledges, but which he would have\ndisregarded had he written a decade or so earlier, is the profundity of\nsome of these obscurations. He says that mere smokiness cannot account\nfor such \"awe-inspiring dark days.\" So he conceives of eddies in the\nair, concentrating the smoke from forest fires. Then, in the\ninconsistency or discord of all quasi-intellection that is striving for\nconsistency or harmony, he tells of the vastness of some of these\ndarknesses. Of course Mr. Plummer did not really think upon this\nsubject, but one does feel that he might have approximated higher to\nreal thinking than by speaking of concentration and then listing data of\nenormous area, or the opposite of circumstances of concentration--because,\nof his nineteen instances, nine are set down as covering all New England. In quasi-existence, everything generates or is part of its own opposite. Every attempt at peace prepares the way for war; all attempts at justice\nresult in injustice in some other respect: so Mr. Plummer's attempt to\nbring order into his data, with the explanation of darkness caused by\nsmoke from forest fires, results in such confusion that he ends up by\nsaying that these daytime darknesses have occurred \"often with little\nor no turbidity of the air near the earth's surface\"--or with no evidence\nat all of smoke--except that there is almost always a forest fire\nsomewhere. However, of the eighteen instances, the only one that I'd bother to\ncontest is the profound darkness in Canada and northern parts of the\nUnited States, Nov. 19, 1819--which we have already considered. Its concomitants:\n\nLights in the sky;\n\nFall of a black substance;\n\nShocks like those of an earthquake. In this instance, the only available forest fire was one to the south of\nthe Ohio River. For all I know, soot from a very great fire south of the\nOhio might fall in Montreal, Canada, and conceivably, by some freak of\nreflection, light from it might be seen in Montreal, but the earthquake\nis not assimilable with a forest fire. On the other hand, it will soon\nbe our expression that profound darkness, fall of matter from the sky,\nlights in the sky, and earthquakes are phenomena of the near approach of\nother worlds to this world. It is such comprehensiveness, as contrasted\nwith inclusion of a few factors and disregard for the rest, that we call\nhigher approximation to realness--or universalness. A darkness, of in the middle of the decade of the 1900s, at Wimbledon, England (_Symons' Met. Mag._, 39-69). It came from a smokeless region: no rain, no thunder;\nlasted 10 minutes; too dark to go \"even out in the open.\"\n\nAs to darknesses in Great Britain, one thinks of fogs--but in _Nature_,\n25-289, there are some observations by Major J. Herschel, upon an\nobscuration in London, Jan. 22, 1882, at 10:30 A.M., so great that he\ncould hear persons upon the opposite side of the street, but could not\nsee them--\"It was obvious that there was no fog to speak of.\"\n\n_Annual Register_, 1857-132:\n\nAn account by Charles A.",

Murray, British Envoy to Persia, of a darkness\nof about 1857, that came upon Bagdad--\"a darkness more intense than\nordinary midnight, when neither stars nor moon are visible....\" \"After a\nshort time the black darkness was succeeded by a red, lurid gloom, such\nas I never saw in any part of the world.\"\n\n\"Panic seized the whole city.\"\n\n\"A dense volume of red sand fell.\"\n\nThis matter of sand falling seems to suggest conventional explanation\nenough, or that a simoon, heavily charged with terrestrial sand, had\nobscured the sun, but Mr. Murray, who says that he had had experience\nwith simoons, gives his opinion that \"it cannot have been a simoon.\"\n\nIt is our comprehensiveness now, or this matter of concomitants of\ndarknesses that we are going to capitalize. It is all very complicated\nand tremendous, and our own treatment can be but impressionistic, but a\nfew of the rudiments of Advanced Seismology we shall now take up--or the\nfour principal phenomena of another world's close approach to this\nworld. If a large substantial mass, or super-construction, should enter\nthis earth's atmosphere, it is our acceptance that it would\nsometimes--depending upon velocity--appear luminous or look like a\ncloud, or like a cloud with a luminous nucleus. Later we shall have an\nexpression upon luminosity--different from the luminosity of\nincandescence--that comes upon objects falling from the sky, or entering\nthis earth's atmosphere. Now our expression is that worlds have often\ncome close to this earth, and that smaller objects--size of a haystack\nor size of several dozen skyscrapers lumped, have often hurtled through\nthis earth's atmosphere, and have been mistaken for clouds, because they\nwere enveloped in clouds--\n\nOr that around something coming from the intense cold of inter-planetary\nspace--that is of some regions: our own suspicion is that other regions\nare tropical--the moisture of this earth's atmosphere would condense\ninto a cloud-like appearance around it. In _Nature_, 20-121, there is an\naccount by Mr. S.W. Clifton, Collector of Customs, at Freemantle,\nWestern Australia, sent to the Melbourne Observatory--a clear\nday--appearance of a small black cloud, moving not very\nswiftly--bursting into a ball of fire, of the apparent size of the\nmoon--\n\nOr that something with the velocity of an ordinary meteorite could not\ncollect vapor around it, but that slower-moving objects--speed of a\nrailway train, say--may. The clouds of tornadoes have so often been described as if they were\nsolid objects that I now accept that sometimes they are: that some\nso-called tornadoes are objects hurtling through this earth's\natmosphere, not only generating disturbances by their suctions, but\ncrushing, with their bulk, all things in their way, rising and falling\nand finally disappearing, demonstrating that gravitation is not the\npower that the primitives think it is, if an object moving at relatively\nlow velocity be not pulled to this earth, or being so momentarily\naffected, bounds away. In Finley's _Reports on the Character of 600 Tornadoes_ very suggestive\nbits of description occur:\n\n\"Cloud bounded along the earth like a ball\"--\n\nOr that it was no meteorological phenomenon, but something very much\nlike a huge solid ball that was bounding along, crushing and carrying\nwith it everything within its field--\n\n\"Cloud bounded along, coming to the earth every eight hundred or one\nthousand yards.\"\n\nHere's an interesting bit that I got somewhere else. I offer it as a\ndatum in super-biology, which, however, is a branch of advanced science\nthat I'll not take up, restricting to things indefinitely called\n\"objects\"--\n\n\"The tornado came wriggling, jumping, whirling like a great green snake,\ndarting out a score of glistening fangs.\"\n\nThough it's interesting, I think that's sensational, myself. It may be\nthat vast green snakes sometimes rush past this earth, taking a swift\nbite wherever they can, but, as I say, that's a super-biologic\nphenomenon. Finley gives dozens of instances of tornado clouds that seem\nto me more like solid things swathed in clouds, than clouds. He notes\nthat, in the tornado at Americus, Georgia, about 1881, \"a strange\nsulphurous vapor was emitted from the cloud.\" In many instances,\nobjects, or meteoritic stones, that have come from this earth's\nexternality, have had a sulphurous odor. Why a wind effect should be\nsulphurous is not clear. That a vast object from external regions\nshould be sulphurous is in line with many data. This phenomenon is\ndescribed in the _Monthly Weather Review_, July, 1881, as \"a strange\nsulphurous vapor ... burning and sickening all who approached close\nenough to breathe it.\"\n\nThe conventional explanation of tornadoes as wind-effects--which we do\nnot deny in some instances--is so strong in the United States that it is\nbetter to look elsewhere for an account of an object that has hurtled\nthrough this earth's atmosphere, rising and falling and defying this\nearth's gravitation. _Nature_, 7-112:\n\nThat, according to a correspondent to the _Birmingham Morning News_, the\npeople living near King's Sutton, Banbury, saw, about one o'clock, Dec. 7, 1872, something like a haycock hurtling through the air.",

Like a\nmeteor it was accompanied by fire and a dense smoke and made a noise\nlike that of a railway train. \"It was sometimes high in the air and\nsometimes near the ground.\" The effect was tornado-like: trees and walls\nwere knocked down. It's a late day now to try to verify this story, but\na list is given of persons whose property was injured. We are told that\nthis thing then disappeared \"all at once.\"\n\nThese are the smaller objects, which may be derailed railway trains or\nbig green snakes, for all I know--but our expression upon approach to\nthis earth by vast dark bodies--\n\nThat likely they'd be made luminous: would envelop in clouds, perhaps,\nor would have their own clouds--\n\nBut that they'd quake, and that they'd affect this earth with quakes--\n\nAnd that then would occur a fall of matter from such a world, or rise of\nmatter from this earth to a nearby world, or both fall and rise, or\nexchange of matter--process known to Advanced Seismology as\ncelestio-metathesis--\n\nExcept that--if matter from some other world--and it would be like\nsomeone to get it into his head that we absolutely deny gravitation,\njust because we cannot accept orthodox dogmas--except that, if matter\nfrom another world, filling the sky of this earth, generally, as to a\nhemisphere, or locally, should be attracted to this earth, it would\nseem thinkable that the whole thing should drop here, and not merely its\nsurface-materials. Objects upon a ship's bottom. From time to time they drop to the bottom\nof the ocean. The ship does not. Or, like our acceptance upon dripping from aerial ice-fields, we think\nof only a part of a nearby world succumbing, except in being caught in\nsuspension, to this earth's gravitation, and surface-materials falling\nfrom that part--\n\nExplain or express or accept, and what does it matter? Our attitude is:\n\nHere are the data. See for yourself. What does it matter what my notions may be? Here are the data. But think for yourself, or think for myself, all mixed up we must be. A\nlong time must go by before we can know Florida from Long Island. So\nwe've had data of fishes that have fallen from our now established and\nrespectabilized Super-Sargasso Sea--which we've almost forgotten, it's\nnow so respectable--but we shall have data of fishes that have fallen\nduring earthquakes. These we accept were dragged down from ponds or\nother worlds that have been quaked, when only a few miles away, by this\nearth, some other world also quaking this earth. In a way, or in its principle, our subject is orthodox enough. Only\ngrant proximity of other worlds--which, however, will not be a matter of\ngranting, but will be a matter of data--and one conventionally conceives\nof their surfaces quaked--even of a whole lake full of fishes being\nquaked and dragged down from one of them. The lake full of fishes may\ncause a little pain to some minds, but the fall of sand and stones is\npleasantly enough thought of. More scientific persons, or more faithful\nhypnotics than we, have taken up this subject, unpainfully, relatively\nto the moon. For instance, Perrey has gone over 15,000 records of\nearthquakes, and he has correlated many with proximities of the moon, or\nhas attributed many to the pull of the moon when nearest this earth. Also there is a paper upon this subject in the _Proc. Roy. Soc. of\nCornwall_, 1845. Or, theoretically, when at its closest to this earth,\nthe moon quakes the face of this earth, and is itself quaked--but does\nnot itself fall to this earth. As to showers of matter that may have\ncome from the moon at such times--one can go over old records and find\nwhat one pleases. That is what we now shall do. Our expressions are for acceptance only. Our data:\n\nWe take them from four classes of phenomena that have preceded or\naccompanied earthquakes:\n\nUnusual clouds, darkness profound, luminous appearances in the sky, and\nfalls of substances and objects whether commonly called meteoritic or\nnot. Not one of these occurrences fits in with principles of primitive, or\nprimary, seismology, and every one of them is a datum of a quaked body\npassing close to this earth or suspended over it. To the primitives\nthere is not a reason in the world why a convulsion of this earth's\nsurface should be accompanied by unusual sights in the sky, by darkness,\nor by the fall of substances or objects from the sky. As to phenomena\nlike these, or storms, preceding earthquakes, the irreconcilability is\nstill greater. It was before 1860 that Perrey made his great compilation. We take most\nof our data from lists compiled long ago.",

We take most\nof our data from lists compiled long ago. Only the safe and unpainful\nhave been published in recent years--at least in ambitious, voluminous\nform. The restraining hand of the \"System\"--as we call it, whether it\nhas any real existence or not--is tight upon the sciences of today. The\nuncanniest aspect of our quasi-existence that I know of is that\neverything that seems to have one identity has also as high a seeming of\neverything else. In this oneness of allness, or continuity, the\nprotecting hand strangles; the parental stifles; love is inseparable\nfrom phenomena of hate. There is only Continuity--that is in\nquasi-existence. _Nature_, at least in its correspondents' columns,\nstill evades this protective strangulation, and the _Monthly Weather\nReview_ is still a rich field of unfaithful observation: but, in looking\nover other long-established periodicals, I have noted their glimmers of\nquasi-individuality fade gradually, after about 1860, and the surrender\nof their attempted identities to a higher attempted organization. Some\nof them, expressing Intermediateness-wide endeavor to localize the\nuniversal, or to localize self, soul, identity, entity--or positiveness\nor realness--held out until as far as 1880; traces findable up to\n1890--and then, expressing the universal process--except that here and\nthere in the world's history there may have been successful\napproximations to positiveness by \"individuals\"--who only then became\nindividuals and attained to selves or souls of their own--surrendered,\nsubmitted, became parts of a higher organization's attempt to\nindividualize or systematize into a complete thing, or to localize the\nuniversal or the attributes of the universal. After the death of Richard\nProctor, whose occasional illiberalities I'd not like to emphasize too\nmuch, all succeeding volumes of _Knowledge_ have yielded scarcely an\nunconventionality. Note the great number of times that the _American\nJournal of Science_ and the _Report of the British Association_ are\nquoted: note that, after, say, 1885, they're scarcely mentioned in these\ninspired but illicit pages--as by hypnosis and inertia, we keep on\nsaying. About 1880. Throttle and disregard. But the coercion could not be positive, and many of the excommunicated\ncontinued to creep in; or, even to this day, some of the strangled are\nfaintly breathing. Some of our data have been hard to find. We could tell stories of great\nlabor and fruitless quests that would, though perhaps imperceptibly,\nstir the sympathy of a Mr. Symons. But, in this matter of concurrence of\nearthquakes with aerial phenomena, which are as unassociable with\nearthquakes, if internally caused, as falls of sand on convulsed small\nboys full of sour apples, the abundance of so-called evidence is so\ngreat that we can only sketchily go over the data, beginning with Robert\nMallet's Catalogue (_Rept. Brit. Assoc._, 1852), omitting some\nextraordinary instances, because they occurred before the eighteenth\ncentury:\n\nEarthquake \"preceded\" by a violent tempest, England, Jan. 8,\n1704--\"preceded\" by a brilliant meteor, Switzerland, Nov. 4,\n1704--\"luminous cloud, moving at high velocity, disappearing behind the\nhorizon,\" Florence, Dec. 9, 1731--\"thick mists in the air, through which\na dim light was seen: several weeks before the shock, globes of light\nhad been seen in the air,\" Swabia, about 1732--rain of earth,\nCarpentras, France, Oct. 18, 1737--a black cloud, London, about 1750s--violent storm and a strange star of octagonal shape, Slavange,\nNorway, about 1752--balls of fire from a streak in the sky,\nAugermannland, 1752--numerous meteorites, Lisbon, Oct. 15,\n1755--\"terrible tempests\" over and over--\"falls of hail\" and \"brilliant\nmeteors,\" instance after instance--\"an immense globe,\" Switzerland, Nov. 2, 1761--oblong, sulphurous cloud, Germany, April, 1767--extraordinary\nmass of vapor, Boulogne, April, 1780--heavens obscured by a dark mist,\nGrenada, Aug. 7, 1804--\"strange, howling noises in the air, and large\nspots obscuring the sun,\" Palermo, Italy, about 1817--\"luminous\nmeteor moving in the same direction as the shock,\" Naples, Nov. 22,\n1821--fire ball appearing in the sky: apparent size of the moon,\nThuringerwald, Nov. 29, 1831. And, unless you be polarized by the New Dominant, which is calling for\nrecognition of multiplicities of external things, as a Dominant, dawning\nnew over Europe in 1492, called for recognition of terrestrial\nexternality to Europe--unless you have this contact with the new, you\nhave no affinity for these data--beans that drop from a\nmagnet--irreconcilables that glide from the mind of a Thomson--\n\nOr my own acceptance that we do not really think at all; that we\ncorrelate around super-magnets that I call Dominants--a Spiritual\nDominant in one age, and responsively to it up spring monasteries, and\nthe stake and the cross are its symbols: a Materialist Dominant, and up\nspring laboratories, and microscopes and telescopes and crucibles are\nits ikons--that we're nothing but iron filings relatively to a\nsuccession of magnets that displace preceding magnets.",

With no soul of your own, and with no soul of my own--except that some\nday some of us may no longer be Intermediatisms, but may hold out\nagainst the cosmos that once upon a time thousands of fishes were cast\nfrom one pail of water--we have psycho-valency for these data, if we're\nobedient slaves to the New Dominant, and repulsion to them, if we're\nmere correlates to the Old Dominant. I'm a soulless and selfless\ncorrelate to the New Dominant, myself: I see what I have to see. The\nonly inducement I can hold out, in my attempt to rake up disciples, is\nthat some day the New will be fashionable: the new correlates will sneer\nat the old correlates. After all, there is some inducement to that--and\nI'm not altogether sure it's desirable to end up as a fixed star. As a correlate to the New Dominant, I am very much impressed with some\nof these data--the luminous object that moved in the same direction as\nan earthquake--it seems very acceptable that a quake followed this thing\nas it passed near this earth's surface. The streak that was seen in the\nsky--or only a streak that was visible of another world--and objects, or\nmeteorites, that were shaken down from it. The quake at Carpentras,\nFrance: and that, above Carpentras, was a smaller world, more violently\nquaked, so that earth was shaken down from it. But I like best the super-wolves that were seen to cross the sun during\nthe earthquake at Palermo. They howled. Or the loves of the worlds. The call they feel for one another. They try\nto move closer and howl when they get there. The howls of the planets. I have discovered a new unintelligibility. In the _Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal_--have to go away back to\n1841--days of less efficient strangulation--Sir David Milne lists\nphenomena of quakes in Great Britain. I pick out a few that indicate to\nme that other worlds were near this earth's surface:\n\nViolent storm before a shock of 1703--ball of fire \"preceding,\" 1750--a\nlarge ball of fire seen upon day following a quake, 1755--\"uncommon\nphenomenon in the air: a large luminous body, bent like a crescent,\nwhich stretched itself over the heavens, 1816--vast ball of fire,\n1750--black rains and black snows, 1755--numerous instances of upward\nprojection--or upward attraction?--during quakes--preceded by a cloud,\nvery black and lowering,\" 1795--fall of black powder, preceding a quake,\nby six hours, 1837. Some of these instances seem to me to be very striking--a smaller world:\nit is greatly racked by the attraction of this earth--black substance is\ntorn down from it--not until six hours later, after an approach still\ncloser, does this earth suffer perturbation. As to the extraordinary\nspectacle of a thing, world, super-construction, that was seen in the\nsky, in 1816, I have not yet been able to find out more. I think that\nhere our acceptance is relatively sound: that this occurrence was\ntremendously of more importance than such occurrence as, say, transits\nof Venus, upon which hundreds of papers have been written--that not\nanother mention have I found, though I have not looked so especially as\nI shall look for more data--that all but undetailed record of this\noccurrence was suppressed. Altogether we have considerable agreement here between data of vast\nmasses that do not fall to this earth, but from which substances fall,\nand data of fields of ice from which ice may not fall, but from which\nwater may drip. I'm beginning to modify: that, at a distance from this\nearth, gravitation has more effect than we have supposed, though less\neffect than the dogmatists suppose and \"prove.\" I'm coming out stronger\nfor the acceptance of a Neutral Zone--that this earth, like other\nmagnets, has a neutral zone, in which is the Super-Sargasso Sea, and in\nwhich other worlds may be buoyed up, though projecting parts may be\nsubject to this earth's attraction--\n\nBut my preference:\n\nHere are the data. I now have one of the most interesting of the new correlates. I think I\nshould have brought it in before, but, whether out of place here,\nbecause not accompanied by earthquake, or not, we'll have it. I offer it\nas an instance of an eclipse, by a vast, dark body, that has been seen\nand reported by an astronomer. The astronomer is M. Lias: the phenomenon\nwas seen by him, at Pernambuco, about 1860s. _Comptes Rendus_, 50-1197:\n\nIt was about noon--sky cloudless--suddenly the light of the sun was\ndiminished. The darkness increased, and, to illustrate its intensity, we\nare told that the planet Venus shone brilliant. But Venus was of low\nvisibility at this time. The observation that burns incense to the New\nDominant is:\n\nThat around the sun appeared a corona.",

The observation that burns incense to the New\nDominant is:\n\nThat around the sun appeared a corona. There are many other instances that indicate proximity of other world's\nduring earthquakes. I note a few--quake and an object in the sky, called\n\"a large, luminous meteor\" (_Quar. Jour. Roy. Inst._, 5-132); luminous\nbody in the sky, earthquake, and fall of sand, Italy, Feb. 12 and 13,\n1870 (_La Science Pour Tous_, 15-159); many reports upon luminous object\nin the sky and earthquake, Connecticut, Feb. 27, 1883 (_Monthly Weather\nReview_, February, 1883); luminous object, or meteor, in the sky, fall\nof stones from the sky, and earthquake, Italy, Jan. 20, 1891\n(_L'Astronomie_, 1891-154); earthquake and prodigious number of luminous\nbodies, or globes, in the air, Boulogne, France, about 1770s (Sestier,\n\"_La Foudre_,\" 1-169); earthquake at Manila, 1863, and \"curious luminous\nappearance in the sky\" (Ponton, _Earthquakes_, p. 124). The most notable appearance of fishes during an earthquake is that of\nRiobamba. Humboldt sketched one of them, and it's an uncanny-looking\nthing. Thousands of them appeared upon the ground during this tremendous\nearthquake. Humboldt says that they were cast up from subterranean\nsources. I think not myself, and have data for thinking not, but there'd\nbe such a row arguing back and forth that it's simpler to consider a\nclearer instance of the fall of living fishes from the sky, during an\nearthquake. I can't quite accept, myself, whether a large lake, and all\nthe fishes in it, was torn down from some other world, or a lake in the\nSuper-Sargasso Sea, distracted between two pulling worlds, was dragged\ndown to this earth--\n\nHere are the data:\n\n_La Science Pour Tous_, 6-191:\n\nFeb. 16, 1861. An earthquake at Singapore. Then came an extraordinary\ndownpour of rain--or as much water as any good-sized lake would consist\nof. For three days this rain or this fall of water came down in\ntorrents. In pools on the ground, formed by this deluge, great numbers\nof fishes were found. The writer says that he had, himself, seen nothing\nbut water fall from the sky. Whether I'm emphasizing what a deluge it\nwas or not, he says that so terrific had been the downpour that he had\nnot been able to see three steps away from him. The natives said that\nthe fishes had fallen from the sky. Three days later the pools dried up\nand many dead fishes were found, but, in the first place--though that's\nan expression for which we have an instinctive dislike--the fishes had\nbeen active and uninjured. Then follows material for another of our\nlittle studies in the phenomena of disregard. A psycho-tropism here is\nmechanically to take pen in hand and mechanically write that fishes\nfound on the ground after a heavy rainfall came from overflowing\nstreams. The writer of the account says that some of the fishes had\nbeen found in his courtyard, which was surrounded by high walls--paying\nno attention to this, a correspondent (_La Science Pour Tous_, 6-317)\nexplains that in the heavy rain a body of water had probably overflowed,\ncarrying fishes with it. We are told by the first writer that these\nfishes of Singapore were of a species that was very abundant near\nSingapore. So I think, myself, that a whole lakeful of them had been\nshaken down from the Super-Sargasso Sea, under the circumstances we have\nthought of. However, if appearance of strange fishes after an earthquake\nbe more pleasing in the sight, or to the nostrils, of the New Dominant,\nwe faithfully and piously supply that incense--An account of the\noccurrence at Singapore was read by M. de Castelnau, before the French\nAcademy. M. de Castelnau recalled that, upon a former occasion, he had\nsubmitted to the Academy the circumstance that fishes of a new species\nhad appeared at the Cape of Good Hope, after an earthquake. It seems proper, and it will give luster to the new orthodoxy, now to\nhave an instance in which, not merely quake and fall of rocks or\nmeteorites, or quake and either eclipse or luminous appearances in the\nsky have occurred, but in which are combined all the phenomena, one or\nmore of which, when accompanying earthquake, indicate, in our\nacceptance, the proximity of another world. This time a longer duration\nis indicated than in other instances. In the _Canadian Institute Proceedings_, 2-7-198, there is an account,\nby the Deputy Commissioner at Dhurmsalla, of the extraordinary\nDhurmsalla meteorite--coated with ice. But the combination of events\nrelated by him is still more extraordinary:\n\nThat within a few months of the fall of this meteorite there had been a\nfall of live fishes at Benares, a shower of red substance at\nFurruckabad, a dark spot observed on the disk of the sun, an earthquake,\n\"an unnatural darkness of some duration,\" and a luminous appearance in\nthe sky that looked like an aurora borealis--\n\nBut there's more to this climax:\n\nWe are introduced to a new order of phenomena:\n\nVisitors. The Deputy Commissioner writes that, in the evening, after the fall of\nthe Dhurmsalla meteorite, or mass of stone covered with ice, he saw\nlights. Some of them were not very high. They appeared and went out and\nreappeared.",

The Deputy Commissioner writes that, in the evening, after the fall of\nthe Dhurmsalla meteorite, or mass of stone covered with ice, he saw\nlights. Some of them were not very high. They appeared and went out and\nreappeared. I have read many accounts of the Dhurmsalla meteorite--about 1860--but never in any other of them a mention of this new\ncorrelate--something as out of place in the nineteenth century as would\nhave been an aeroplane--the invention of which would not, in our\nacceptance, have been permitted, in the nineteenth century, though\nadumbrations to it were permitted. This writer says that the lights\nmoved like fire balloons, but:\n\n\"I am sure that they were neither fire balloons, lanterns, nor bonfires,\nor any other thing of that sort, but bona fide lights in the heavens.\"\n\nIt's a subject for which we shall have to have a separate\nexpression--trespassers upon territory to which something else has a\nlegal right--perhaps someone lost a rock, and he and his friends came\ndown looking for it, in the evening--or secret agents, or emissaries,\nwho had an appointment with certain esoteric ones near Dhurmsalla--things\nor beings coming down to explore, and unable to stay down long--\n\nIn a way, another strange occurrence during an earthquake is suggested. The ancient Chinese tradition--the marks like hoof marks in the ground. We have thought--with a low degree of acceptance--of another world that\nmay be in secret communication with certain esoteric ones of this\nearth's inhabitants--and of messages in symbols like hoof marks that are\nsent to some receptor, or special hill, upon this earth--and of messages\nthat at times miscarry. This other world comes close to this world--there are quakes--but\nadvantage of proximity is taken to send a message--the message, designed\nfor a receptor in India, perhaps, or in Central Europe, miscarries all\nthe way to England--marks like the marks of the Chinese tradition are\nfound upon a beach, in Cornwall, after an earthquake--\n\n_Phil. Trans._, 50-500:\n\nAfter the quake of late in the decade of the 1750s, upon the sands of Penzance, Cornwall,\nin an area of more than 100 square yards, were found marks like hoof\nprints, except that they were not crescentic. We feel a similarity, but\nnote an arbitrary disregard of our own, this time. It seems to us that\nmarks described as \"little cones surrounded by basins of equal diameter\"\nwould be like hoof prints, if hoofs printed complete circles. Other\ndisregards are that there were black specks on the tops of cones, as if\nsomething, perhaps gaseous, had issued from them; that from one of these\nformations came a gush of water as thick as a man's wrist. Of course the\nopening of springs is common in earthquakes--but we suspect, myself,\nthat the Negative Absolute is compelling us to put in this datum and its\ndisorders. There's another matter in which the Negative Absolute seems to work\nagainst us. Though to super-chemistry, we have introduced the principle\nof celestio-metathesis, we have no good data of exchange of substances\nduring proximities. The data are all of falls and not of upward\ntranslations. Of course upward impulses are common during earthquakes,\nbut I haven't a datum upon a tree or a fish or a brick or a man that\never did go up and stay up and that never did come down again. Our\nclassic of the horse and barn occurred in what was called a whirlwind. It is said that, in an earthquake in Calabria, paving stones shot up far\nin the air. The writer doesn't specifically say that they came down again, but\nsomething seems to tell me they did. The corpses of Riobamba. Humboldt reported that, in the quake of Riobamba, \"bodies were torn\nupward from graves\"; that \"the vertical motion was so strong that bodies\nwere tossed several hundred feet in the air.\"\n\nI explain. I explain that, if in the center of greatest violence of an earthquake,\nanything ever has gone up, and has kept on going up, the thoughts of the\nnearest observers were very likely upon other subjects. The quay of Lisbon. We are told that it went down. A vast throng of persons ran to the quay for refuge. The city of Lisbon\nwas in profound darkness. The quay and all the people on it disappeared. If it and they went down--not a single corpse, not a shred of clothing,\nnot a plank of the quay, nor so much as a splinter of it ever floated to\nthe surface. The New Dominant. I mean \"primarily\" all that opposes Exclusionism--\n\nThat Development or Progress or Evolution is Attempt to Positivize, and\nis a mechanism by which a positive existence is recruited--that what we\ncall existence is a womb of infinitude, and is itself only\nincubatory--that eventually all attempts are broken down by the falsely\nexcluded. Subjectively, the breaking down is aided by our own sense of\nfalse and narrow limitations. So the classic and academic artists\nwrought positivist paintings, and expressed the only ideal that I am\nconscious of, though we so often hear of \"ideals\" instead of different\nmanifestations, artistically, scientifically, theologically,\npolitically, of the One Ideal.",

So the classic and academic artists\nwrought positivist paintings, and expressed the only ideal that I am\nconscious of, though we so often hear of \"ideals\" instead of different\nmanifestations, artistically, scientifically, theologically,\npolitically, of the One Ideal. They sought to satisfy, in its artistic\naspect, cosmic craving for unity or completeness, sometimes called\nharmony, called beauty in some aspects. By disregard they sought\ncompleteness. But the light-effects that they disregarded, and their\nnarrow confinement to standardized subjects brought on the revolt of the\nImpressionists. So the Puritans tried to systematize, and they\ndisregarded physical needs, or vices, or relaxations: they were invaded\nand overthrown when their narrowness became obvious and intolerable. All\nthings strive for positiveness, for themselves, or for quasi-systems of\nwhich they are parts. Formality and the mathematic, the regular and the\nuniform are aspects of the positive state--but the Positive is the\nUniversal--so all attempted positiveness that seems to satisfy in the\naspects of formality and regularity, sooner or later disqualifies in the\naspect of wideness or universalness. So there is revolt against the\nscience of today, because the formulated utterances that were regarded\nas final truths in a past generation, are now seen to be\ninsufficiencies. Every pronouncement that has opposed our own\nacceptances has been found to be a composition like any academic\npainting: something that is arbitrarily cut off from relations with\nenvironment, or framed off from interfering and disturbing data, or\noutlined with disregards. Our own attempt has been to take in the\nincluded, but also to take in the excluded into wider expressions. We\naccept, however, that for every one of our expressions there are\nirreconcilables somewhere--that final utterance would include all\nthings. However, of such is the gossip of angels. The final is\nunutterable in quasi-existence, where to think is to include but also to\nexclude, or be not final. If we admit that for every opinion we have\nexpressed, there must somewhere be an irreconcilable, we are\nIntermediatists and not positivists; not even higher positivists. Of\ncourse it may be that some day we shall systematize and dogmatize and\nrefuse to think of anything that we may be accused of disregarding, and\nbelieve instead of merely accepting: then, if we could have a wider\nsystem, which would acknowledge no irreconcilables we'd be higher\npositivists. So long as we only accept, we are not higher positivists,\nbut our feeling is that the New Dominant, even though we have thought of\nit only as another enslavement, will be the nucleus for higher\npositivism--and that it will be the means of elevating into infinitude a\nnew batch of fixed stars--until, as a recruiting instrument, it, too,\nwill play out, and will give way to some new medium for generating\nabsoluteness. It is our acceptance that all astronomers of today have\nlost their souls, or, rather, all chance of attaining Entity, but that\nCopernicus and Kepler and Galileo and Newton, and, conceivably,\nLeverrier are now fixed stars. Some day I shall attempt to identify\nthem. In all this, I think we're quite a Moses. We point out the\nPromised Land, but, unless we be cured of our Intermediatism, will never\nbe reported in _Monthly Notices_, ourself. In our acceptance, Dominants, in their succession, displace preceding\nDominants not only because they are more nearly positive, but because\nthe old Dominants, as recruiting mediums, play out. Our expression is\nthat the New Dominant, of Wider Inclusions, is now manifesting\nthroughout the world, and that the old Exclusionism is everywhere\nbreaking down. In physics Exclusionism is breaking down by its own\nresearches in radium, for instance, and in its speculations upon\nelectrons, or its merging away into metaphysics, and by the desertion\nthat has been going on for many years, by such men as Gurney, Crookes,\nWallace, Flammarion, Lodge, to formerly disregarded phenomena--no longer\ncalled \"spiritualism\" but now \"psychic research.\" Biology is in chaos:\nconventional Darwinites mixed up with mutationists and orthogenesists\nand followers of Wisemann, who take from Darwinism one of its\npseudo-bases, and nevertheless try to reconcile their heresies with\northodoxy. The painters are metaphysicians and psychologists. The\nbreaking down of Exclusionism in China and Japan and in the United\nStates has astonished History. The science of astronomy is going\ndownward so that, though Pickering, for instance, did speculate upon a\nTrans-Neptunian planet, and Lowell did try to have accepted heretical\nideas as to marks on Mars, attention is now minutely focused upon such\ntechnicalities as variations in shades of Jupiter's fourth satellite. I\nthink that, in general acceptance, over-refinement indicates decadence. I think that the stronghold of Inclusionism is in aeronautics. I think\nthat the stronghold of the Old Dominant, when it was new, was in the\ninvention of the telescope.",

I\nthink that, in general acceptance, over-refinement indicates decadence. I think that the stronghold of Inclusionism is in aeronautics. I think\nthat the stronghold of the Old Dominant, when it was new, was in the\ninvention of the telescope. Or that coincidentally with the breakdown of\nExclusionism appears the means of finding out--whether there are vast\naerial fields of ice and floating lakes full of frogs and fishes or\nnot--where carved stones and black substances and great quantities of\nvegetable matter and flesh, which may be dragons' flesh, come\nfrom--whether there are inter-planetary trade routes and vast areas\ndevastated by Super-Tamerlanes--whether sometimes there are visitors to\nthis earth--who might be pursued and captured and questioned. I have industriously sought data for an expression upon birds, but the\nprospecting has not been very quasi-satisfactory. I think I rather\nemphasize our industriousness, because a charge likely to be brought\nagainst the attitude of Acceptance is that one who only accepts must be\none of languid interest and little application of energy. It doesn't\nseem to work out: we are very industrious. I suggest to some of our\ndisciples that they look into the matter of messages upon pigeons, of\ncourse attributed to earthly owners, but said to be undecipherable. I'd\ndo it, ourselves, only that would be selfish. That's more of the\nIntermediatism that will keep us out of the firmament: Positivism is\nabsolute egoism. But look back in the time of Andr\u00e9e's Polar Expedition. Pigeons that would have no publicity ordinarily, were often reported at\nthat time. In the _Zoologist_, 3-18-21, is recorded an instance of a bird (puffin)\nthat had fallen to the ground with a fractured head. Interesting, but\nmere speculation--but what solid object, high in the air, had that bird\nstruck against? Tremendous red rain in France, Oct. 16 and 17, 1846; great storm at the\ntime, and red rain supposed to have been colored by matter swept up from\nthis earth's surface, and then precipitated (_Comptes Rendus_, 23-832). But in _Comptes Rendus_, 24-625, the description of this red rain\ndiffers from one's impression of red, sandy or muddy water. It is said\nthat this rain was so vividly red and so blood-like that many persons in\nFrance were terrified. Two analyses are given (_Comptes Rendus_,\n24-812). One chemist notes a great quantity of corpuscles--whether\nblood-like corpuscles or not--in the matter. The other chemist sets down\norganic matter at 35 per cent. It may be that an inter-planetary dragon\nhad been slain somewhere, or that this red fluid, in which were many\ncorpuscles, came from something not altogether pleasant to contemplate,\nabout the size of the Catskill Mountains, perhaps--but the present\ndatum is that with this substance, larks, quail, ducks, and water hens,\nsome of them alive, fell at Lyons and Grenoble and other places. I have notes upon other birds that have fallen from the sky, but\nunaccompanied by the red rain that makes the fall of birds in France\npeculiar, and very peculiar, if it be accepted that the red substance\nwas extra-mundane. The other notes are upon birds that have fallen from\nthe sky, in the midst of storms, or of exhausted, but living, birds,\nfalling not far from a storm-area. But now we shall have an instance for\nwhich I can find no parallel: fall of dead birds, from a clear sky,\nfar-distant from any storm to which they could be attributed--so remote\nfrom any discoverable storm that--\n\nMy own notion is that, in the summer of 1896, something, or some beings,\ncame as near to this earth as they could, upon a hunting expedition;\nthat, in the summer of 1896, an expedition of super-scientists passed\nover this earth, and let down a dragnet--and what would it catch,\nsweeping through the air, supposing it to have reached not quite to this\nearth? In the _Monthly Weather Review_, May, 1917, W.L. McAtee quotes from the\nBaton Rouge correspondence to the _Philadelphia Times_:\n\nThat, in the summer of 1896, into the streets of Baton Rouge, La., and\nfrom a \"clear sky,\" fell hundreds of dead birds. There were wild ducks\nand cat birds, woodpeckers, and \"many birds of strange plumage,\" some of\nthem resembling canaries. Usually one does not have to look very far from any place to learn of a\nstorm. But the best that could be done in this instance was to say:\n\n\"There had been a storm on the coast of Florida.\"\n\nAnd, unless he have psycho-chemic repulsion for the explanation, the\nreader feels only momentary astonishment that dead birds from a storm in\nFlorida should fall from an unstormy sky in Louisiana, and with his\nintellect greased like the plumage of a wild duck, the datum then drops\noff. Our greasy, shiny brains. That they may be of some use after all: that\nother modes of existence place a high value upon them as lubricants;\nthat we're hunted for them; a hunting expedition to this earth--the\nnewspapers report a tornado. If from a clear sky, or a sky in which there were no driven clouds, or\nother evidences of still-continuing wind-power--or, if from a storm in\nFlorida, it could be accepted that hundreds of birds had fallen far\naway, in Louisiana, I conceive, conventionally, of heavier objects\nhaving fallen in Alabama, say, and of the fall of still heavier objects\nstill nearer the origin in Florida. The sources of information of the Weather Bureau are widespread. It has no records of such falls.",

The sources of information of the Weather Bureau are widespread. It has no records of such falls. So a dragnet that was let down from above somewhere--\n\nOr something that I learned from the more scientific of the\ninvestigators of psychic phenomena:\n\nThe reader begins their works with prejudice against telepathy\nand everything else of psychic phenomena. The writers deny\nspirit-communication, and say that the seeming data are data of \"only\ntelepathy.\" Astonishing instances of seeming clairvoyance--\"only\ntelepathy.\" After a while the reader finds himself agreeing that it's\nonly telepathy--which, at first, had been intolerable to him. So maybe, in 1896, a super-dragnet did not sweep through this earth's\natmosphere, gathering up all the birds within its field, the meshes then\nsuddenly breaking--\n\nOr that the birds of Baton Rouge were only from the Super-Sargasso Sea--\n\nUpon which we shall have another expression. We thought we'd settled\nthat, and we thought we'd establish that, but nothing's ever settled,\nand nothing's ever established, in a real sense, if, in a real sense,\nthere is nothing in quasiness. I suppose there had been a storm somewhere, the storm in Florida,\nperhaps, and many birds had been swept upward into the Super-Sargasso\nSea. It has frigid regions and it has tropical regions--that birds of\ndiverse species had been swept upward, into an icy region, where,\nhuddling together for warmth, they had died. Then, later, they had been\ndislodged--meteor coming along--boat--bicycle--dragon--don't know what\ndid come along--something dislodged them. So leaves of trees, carried up there in whirlwinds, staying there years,\nages, perhaps only a few months, but then falling to this earth at an\nunseasonable time for dead leaves--fishes carried up there, some of them\ndying and drying, some of them living in volumes of water that are in\nabundance up there, or that fall sometimes in the deluges that we call\n\"cloudbursts.\"\n\nThe astronomers won't think kindly of us, and we haven't done anything\nto endear ourselves to the meteorologists--but we're weak and mawkish\nIntermediatists--several times we've tried to get the aeronauts with\nus--extraordinary things up there: things that curators of museums would\ngive up all hope of ever being fixed stars, to obtain: things left over\nfrom whirlwinds of the time of the Pharaohs, perhaps: or that Elijah did\ngo up in the sky in something like a chariot, and may not be Vega, after\nall, and that there may be a wheel or so left of whatever he went up in. We basely suggest that it would bring a high price--but sell soon,\nbecause after a while there'd be thousands of them hawked around--\n\nWe weakly drop a hint to the aeronauts. In the _Scientific American_, 33-197, there is an account of some hay\nthat fell from the sky. From the circumstances we incline to accept that\nthis hay went up, in a whirlwind, from this earth, in the first place,\nreached the Super-Sargasso Sea, and remained there a long time before\nfalling. An interesting point in this expression is the usual\nattribution to a local and coinciding whirlwind, and identification of\nit--and then data that make that local whirlwind unacceptable--\n\nThat, upon about 1875, small masses of damp hay had fallen at\nMonkstown, Ireland. In the _Dublin Daily Express_, Dr. J.W. Moore had\nexplained: he had found a nearby whirlwind, to the south of Monkstown,\nthat coincided. But, according to the _Scientific American_, a similar\nfall had occurred near Wrexham, England, two days before. In November, 1918, I made some studies upon light objects thrown into\nthe air. Armistice-day. I suppose I should have been more emotionally\noccupied, but I made notes upon torn-up papers thrown high in the air\nfrom windows of office buildings. Scraps of paper did stay together for\na while. Several minutes, sometimes. _Cosmos_, 3-4-574:\n\nThat, upon the 10th of April, 1869, at Autriche (Indre-et-Loire) a\ngreat number of oak leaves--enormous segregation of them--fell from the\nsky. Very calm day. So little wind that the leaves fell almost\nvertically. Fall lasted about ten minutes. Flammarion, in _The Atmosphere_, p. 412, tells this story. He has to find a storm. He does find a squall--but it had occurred upon April 3rd. Flammarion's two incredibilities are--that leaves could remain a week in\nthe air: that they could stay together a week in the air. Think of some of your own observations upon papers thrown from an\naeroplane. Our one incredibility:\n\nThat these leaves had been whirled up six months before, when they were\ncommon on the ground, and had been sustained, of course not in the air,\nbut in a region gravitationally inert; and had been precipitated by the\ndisturbances of April rains. I have no records of leaves that have so fallen from the sky in October\nor November, the season when one might expect dead leaves to be raised\nfrom one place and precipitated somewhere else. I emphasize that this\noccurred in April.",

I emphasize that this\noccurred in April. _La Nature_, 1889-2-94:\n\nThat, upon about 1889, dried leaves, of different species, oak, elm,\netc., fell from the sky. This day, too, was a calm day. The fall was\ntremendous. The leaves were seen to fall fifteen minutes, but, judging\nfrom the quantity on the ground, it is the writer's opinion that they\nhad already been falling half an hour. I think that the geyser of\ncorpses that sprang from Riobamba toward the sky must have been an\ninteresting sight. If I were a painter, I'd like that subject. But this\ncataract of dried leaves, too, is a study in the rhythms of the dead. In\nthis datum, the point most agreeable to us is the very point that the\nwriter in _La Nature_ emphasizes. Windlessness. He says that the surface\nof the Loire was \"absolutely smooth.\" The river was strewn with leaves\nas far as he could see. _L'Astronomie_, 1894-194:\n\nThat, upon the 7th of April, 1894, dried leaves fell at Clairvaux and\nOutre-Aube, France. The fall is described as prodigious. Half an hour. Then, upon the 11th, a fall of dried leaves occurred at Pontcarr\u00e9. It is in this recurrence that we found some of our opposition to the\nconventional explanation. The Editor (Flammarion) explains. He says that\nthe leaves had been caught up in a cyclone which had expended its force;\nthat the heavier leaves had fallen first. We think that that was all\nright for 1894, and that it was quite good enough for 1894. But, in\nthese more exacting days, we want to know how wind-power insufficient to\nhold some leaves in the air could sustain others four days. The factors in this expression are unseasonableness, not for dried\nleaves, but for prodigious numbers of dried leaves; direct fall,\nwindlessness, month of April, and localization in France. The factor of\nlocalization is interesting. Not a note have I upon fall of leaves from\nthe sky, except these notes. Were the conventional explanation, or \"old\ncorrelate\" acceptable, it would seem that similar occurrences in other\nregions should be as frequent as in France. The indication is that there\nmay be quasi-permanent undulations in the Super-Sargasso Sea, or a\npronounced inclination toward France--\n\nInspiration:\n\nThat there may be a nearby world complementary to this world, where\nautumn occurs at the time that is springtime here. Let some disciple have that. But there may be a dip toward France, so that leaves that are borne high\nthere, are more likely to be held in suspension than highflying leaves\nelsewhere. Some other time I shall take up Super-geography, and be\nguilty of charts. I think, now, that the Super-Sargasso Sea is an\noblique belt, with changing ramifications, over Great Britain, France,\nItaly, and on to India. Relatively to the United States I am not very\nclear, but think especially of the Southern States. The preponderance of our data indicates frigid regions aloft. Nevertheless such phenomena as putrefaction have occurred often enough\nto make super-tropical regions, also, acceptable. We shall have one more\ndatum upon the Super-Sargasso Sea. It seems to me that, by this time,\nour requirements of support and reinforcement and agreement have been\nquite as rigorous for acceptance as ever for belief: at least for full\nacceptance. By virtue of mere acceptance, we may, in some later book,\ndeny the Super-Sargasso Sea, and find that our data relate to some other\ncomplementary world instead--or the moon--and have abundant data for\naccepting that the moon is not more than twenty or thirty miles away. However, the Super-Sargasso Sea functions very well as a nucleus around\nwhich to gather data that oppose Exclusionism. That is our main motive:\nto oppose Exclusionism. Or our agreement with cosmic processes. The climax of our general\nexpression upon the Super-Sargasso Sea. Coincidentally appears something\nelse that may overthrow it later. _Notes and Queries_, 8-12-228:\n\nThat in the province of Macerata, Italy (summer of 1897?) an immense\nnumber of small, blood-colored clouds covered the sky.

But it is our acceptance that these\nseeds had, for a considerable time, been in a warm region, and for a\ntime longer than is attributable to suspension by wind-power:\n\n\"It is said that a great number of the seeds were in the first stage of\ngermination.\"\n\n\nThe New Dominant.

Inclusionism. In it we have a pseudo-standard. We have a datum, and we give it an interpretation, in accordance with\nour pseudo-standard. At present we have not the delusions of Absolutism\nthat may have translated some of the positivists of the nineteenth\ncentury to heaven. We are Intermediatists--but feel a lurking suspicion\nthat we may some day solidify and dogmatize and illiberalize into higher\npositivists. At present we do not ask whether something be reasonable or\npreposterous, because we recognize that by reasonableness and\npreposterousness are meant agreement and disagreement with a\nstandard--which must be a delusion--though not absolutely, of\ncourse--and must some day be displaced by a more advanced\nquasi-delusion. Scientists in the past have taken the positivist\nattitude--is this or that reasonable or unreasonable? Analyze them and\nwe find that they meant relatively to a standard, such as Newtonism,\nDaltonism, Darwinism, or Lyellism. But they have written and spoken and\nthought as if they could mean real reasonableness and real\nunreasonableness. So our pseudo-standard is Inclusionism, and, if a datum be a correlate\nto a more widely inclusive outlook as to this earth and its externality\nand relations with externality, its harmony with Inclusionism admits it. Such was the process, and such was the requirement for admission in the\ndays of the Old Dominant: our difference is in underlying\nIntermediatism, or consciousness that though we're more nearly real, we\nand our standards are only quasi--\n\nOr that all things--in our intermediate state--are phantoms in a\nsuper-mind in a dreaming state--but striving to awaken to realness. Though in some respects our own Intermediatism is unsatisfactory, our\nunderlying feeling is--\n\nThat in a dreaming mind awakening is accelerated--if phantoms in that\nmind know that they're only phantoms in a dream. Of course, they too are\nquasi, or--but in a relative sense--they have an essence of what is\ncalled realness. They are derived from experience or from\nsenes-relations, even though grotesque distortions. It seems acceptable\nthat a table that is seen when one is awake is more nearly real than a\ndreamed table, which, with fifteen or twenty legs, chases one. So now, in the twentieth century, with a change of terms, and a change\nin underlying consciousness, our attitude toward the New Dominant is the\nattitude of the scientists of the nineteenth century to the Old\nDominant. We do not insist that our data and interpretations shall be\nas shocking, grotesque, evil, ridiculous, childish, insincere,\nlaughable, ignorant to nineteenth-centuryites as were their data and\ninterpretations to the medieval-minded. We ask only whether data and\ninterpretations correlate. If they do, they are acceptable, perhaps only\nfor a short time, or as nuclei, or scaffolding, or preliminary sketches,\nor as gropings and tentativenesses. Later, of course, when we cool off\nand harden and radiate into space most of our present mobility, which\nexpresses in modesty and plasticity, we shall acknowledge no\nscaffoldings, gropings or tentativenesses, but think we utter absolute\nfacts. A point in Intermediatism here is opposed to most current\nspeculations upon Development. Usually one thinks of the spiritual as\nhigher than the material, but, in our acceptance, quasi-existence is a\nmeans by which the absolutely immaterial materializes absolutely, and,\nbeing intermediate, is a state in which nothing is finally either\nimmaterial or material, all objects, substances, thoughts, occupying\nsome grade of approximation one way or the other. Final solidification\nof the ethereal is, to us, the goal of cosmic ambition. Positivism is\nPuritanism. Heat is Evil. Final Good is Absolute Frigidity. An Arctic\nwinter is very beautiful, but I think that an interest in monkeys\nchattering in palm trees accounts for our own Intermediatism. Visitors.

Then, on the other hand, we may have data of super-scientific attempts\nto investigate phenomena of this earth from above--perhaps by beings\nfrom so far away that they had never even heard that something,\nsomewhere, asserts a legal right to this earth. Altogether, we're good intermediatists, but we can't be very good\nhypnotists. Still another source of the merging away of our data:\n\nThat, upon general principles of Continuity, if super-vessels, or\nsuper-vehicles, have traversed this earth's atmosphere, there must be\nmergers between them and terrestrial phenomena: observations upon them\nmust merge away into observations upon clouds and balloons and meteors. We shall begin with data that we cannot distinguish ourselves and work\nour way out of mergers into extremes. In the _Observatory_, 35-168, it is said that, according to a newspaper,\nabout 1912, residents of Warmley, England, were greatly excited by\nsomething that was supposed to be \"a splendidly illuminated aeroplane,\npassing over the village.\" \"The machine was apparently traveling at a\ntremendous rate, and came from the direction of Bath, and went on toward\nGloucester.\" The Editor says that it was a large, triple-headed\nfireball. \"Tremendous indeed!\" he says. \"But we are prepared for\nanything nowadays.\"\n\nThat is satisfactory. We'd not like to creep up stealthily and then jump\nout of a corner with our data. This Editor, at least, is prepared to\nread--\n\n_Nature_, Oct. 27, 1898:\n\nA correspondent writes that, in the County Wicklow, Ireland, at about 6\no'clock in the evening, he had seen, in the sky, an object that looked\nlike the moon in its three-quarter aspect. We note the shape which\napproximates to triangularity, and we note that in color it is said to\nhave been golden yellow. It moved slowly, and in about five minutes\ndisappeared behind a mountain. The Editor gives his opinion that the object may have been an escaped\nballoon. In _Nature_, Aug. 11, 1898, there is a story, taken from the July number\nof the _Canadian Weather Review_, by the meteorologist, F.F. Payne: that\nhe had seen, in the Canadian sky, a large, pear-shaped object, sailing\nrapidly. At first he supposed that the object was a balloon, \"its\noutline being sharply defined.\" \"But, as no cage was seen, it was\nconcluded that it must be a mass of cloud.\" In about six minutes this\nobject became less definite--whether because of increasing distance or\nnot--\"the mass became less dense, and finally it disappeared.\" As to\ncyclonic formation--\"no whirling motion could be seen.\"\n\n_Nature_, 58-294:\n\nThat, upon about 1898, a correspondent had seen, at Kiel, an object in\nthe sky, colored red by the sun, which had set. It was about as broad as\na rainbow, and about twelve degrees high. \"It remained in its original\nbrightness about five minutes, and then faded rapidly, and then remained\nalmost stationary again, finally disappearing about eight minutes after\nI first saw it.\"\n\nIn an intermediate existence, we quasi-persons have nothing to judge by\nbecause everything is its own opposite. If a hundred dollars a week be a\nstandard of luxurious living to some persons, it is poverty to others. We have instances of three objects that were seen in the sky in a space\nof three months, and this concurrence seems to me to be something to\njudge by. Science has been built upon concurrence: so have been most of\nthe fallacies and fanaticisms.",

I feel the positivism of a Leverrier, or\ninstinctively take to the notion that all three of these observations\nrelate to the same object. However, I don't formulate them and predict\nthe next transit. Here's another chance for me to become a fixed\nstar--but as usual--oh, well--\n\nA point in Intermediatism:\n\nThat the Intermediatist is likely to be a flaccid compromiser. Our own attitude:\n\nOurs is a partly positive and partly negative state, or a state in which\nnothing is finally positive or finally negative--\n\nBut, if positivism attract you, go ahead and try: you will be in harmony\nwith cosmic endeavor--but Continuity will resist you. Only to have\nappearance in quasiness is to be proportionately positive, but beyond a\ndegree of attempted positivism, Continuity will rise to pull you back. Success, as it is called--though there is only success-failure in\nIntermediateness--will, in Intermediateness, be yours proportionately as\nyou are in adjustment with its own state, or some positivism mixed with\ncompromise and retreat. To be very positive is to be a Napoleon\nBonaparte, against whom the rest of civilization will sooner or later\ncombine. For interesting data, see newspaper accounts of fate of one\nDowie, of Chicago. Intermediatism, then, is recognition that our state is only a\nquasi-state: it is no bar to one who desires to be positive: it is\nrecognition that he cannot be positive and remain in a state that is\npositive-negative. Or that a great positivist--isolated--with no system\nto support him--will be crucified, or will starve to death, or will be\nput in jail and beaten to death--that these are the birth-pangs of\ntranslation to the Positive Absolute. So, though positive-negative, myself, I feel the attraction of the\npositive pole of our intermediate state, and attempt to correlate these\nthree data: to see them homogeneously; to think that they relate to one\nobject. In the aeronautic journals and in the London _Times_ there is no mention\nof escaped balloons, in the summer or fall of 1898. In the _New York\nTimes_ there is no mention of ballooning in Canada or the United States,\nin the summer of 1898. London _Times_, Sept. 29, 1885:\n\nA clipping from the _Royal Gazette_, of Bermuda, of Sept. 8, 1885, sent\nto the _Times_ by General Lefroy:\n\nThat, upon Aug. 27, 1885, at about 8:30 A.M., there was observed by Mrs. Adelina D. Bassett, \"a strange object in the clouds, coming from the\nnorth.\" She called the attention of Mrs. L. Lowell to it, and they were\nboth somewhat alarmed. However, they continued to watch the object\nsteadily for some time. It drew nearer. It was of triangular shape, and\nseemed to be about the size of a pilot-boat mainsail, with chains\nattached to the bottom of it. While crossing the land it had appeared to\ndescend, but, as it went out to sea, it ascended, and continued to\nascend, until it was lost to sight high in the clouds. Or with such power to ascend, I don't think much myself of the notion\nthat it was an escaped balloon, partly deflated. Nevertheless, General\nLefroy, correlating with Exclusionism, attempts to give a terrestrial\ninterpretation to this occurrence. He argues that the thing may have\nbeen a balloon that had escaped from France or England--or the only\naerial thing of terrestrial origin that, even to this date of about\nthirty-five years later, has been thought to have crossed the Atlantic\nOcean. He accounts for the triangular form by deflation--\"a shapeless\nbag, barely able to float.\" My own acceptance is that great deflation\ndoes not accord with observations upon its power to ascend. In the _Times_, Oct. 1, 1885, Charles Harding, of the R.M.S., argues\nthat if it had been a balloon from Europe, surely it would have been\nseen and reported by many vessels. Whether he was as good a Briton as\nthe General or not, he shows awareness of the United States--or that the\nthing may have been a partly collapsed balloon that had escaped from the\nUnited States. General Lefroy wrote to _Nature_ about it (_Nature_, 33-99),\nsaying--whatever his sensitivenesses may have been--that the columns of\nthe _Times_ were \"hardly suitable\" for such a discussion. If, in the\npast, there had been more persons like General Lefroy, we'd have better\nthan the mere fragments of data that in most cases are too broken up\nvery well to piece together. He took the trouble to write to a friend of\nhis, W.H. Gosling, of Bermuda--who also was an extraordinary person. He\nwent to the trouble of interviewing Mrs. Bassett and Mrs. Lowell. Their\ndescription to him was somewhat different:\n\nAn object from which nets were suspended--\n\nDeflated balloon, with its network hanging from it--\n\nA super-dragnet? That something was trawling overhead? The birds of Baton Rouge. Mr. Gosling wrote that the item of chains, or suggestion of a basket\nthat had been attached, had originated with Mr. Bassett, who had not\nseen the object. Mr. Gosling mentioned a balloon that had escaped from\nParis in July. He tells of a balloon that fell in Chicago, September 17,\nor three weeks later than the Bermuda object.",

It's one incredibility against another, with disregards and convictions\ngoverned by whichever of the two Dominants looms stronger in each\nreader's mind. That he can't think for himself any more than I can is\nunderstood. My own correlates:\n\nI think that we're fished for. It may be that we're highly esteemed by\nsuper-epicures somewhere. It makes me more cheerful when I think that we\nmay be of some use after all. I think that dragnets have often come down\nand have been mistaken for whirlwinds and waterspouts. Some accounts of\nseeming structure in whirlwinds and waterspouts are astonishing. And I\nhave data that, in this book, I can't take up at all--mysterious\ndisappearances. I think we're fished for. But this is a little\nexpression on the side: relates to trespassers; has nothing to do with\nthe subject that I shall take up at some other time--or our use to some\nother mode of seeming that has a legal right to us. _Nature_, 33-137:\n\n\"Our Paris correspondent writes that in relation to the balloon which is\nsaid to have been seen over Bermuda, in September, no ascent took place\nin France which can account for it.\"\n\nLast of August: not September. In the London _Times_ there is no mention\nof balloon ascents in Great Britain, in the summer of 1885, but mention\nof two ascents in France. Both balloons had escaped. In _L'A\u00e9ronaute_,\nAugust, 1885, it is said that these balloons had been sent up from f\u00eates\nof the fourteenth of July--44 days before the observation at Bermuda. The aeronauts were Gower and Eloy. Gower's balloon was found floating on\nthe ocean, but Eloy's balloon was not found. Upon the 17th of July it\nwas reported by a sea captain: still in the air; still inflated. But this balloon of Eloy's was a small exhibition balloon, made for\nshort ascents from f\u00eates and fair grounds. In _La Nature_, 1885-2-131,\nit is said that it was a very small balloon, incapable of remaining long\nin the air. As to contemporaneous ballooning in the United States, I find only one\naccount: an ascent in Connecticut, about 1885. Upon leaving this\nballoon, the aeronauts had pulled the \"rip cord,\" \"turning it inside\nout.\" (_New York Times_, Aug. 10, 1885.)\n\nTo the Intermediatist, the accusation of \"anthropomorphism\" is\nmeaningless. There is nothing in anything that is unique or positively\ndifferent. We'd be materialists were it not quite as rational to express\nthe material in terms of the immaterial as to express the immaterial in\nterms of the material. Oneness of allness in quasiness. I will engage to\nwrite the formula of any novel in psycho-chemic terms, or draw its\ngraph in psycho-mechanic terms: or write, in romantic terms, the\ncircumstances and sequences of any chemic or electric or magnetic\nreaction: or express any historic event in algebraic terms--or see Boole\nand Jevons for economic situations expressed algebraically. I think of the Dominants as I think of persons--not meaning that they\nare real persons--not meaning that we are real persons--\n\nOr the Old Dominant and its jealousy, and its suppression of all things\nand thoughts that endangered its supremacy. In reading discussions of\npapers, by scientific societies, I have often noted how, when they\napproached forbidden--or irreconcilable--subjects, the discussions were\nthrown into confusion and ramification. It's as if scientific\ndiscussions have often been led astray--as if purposefully--as if by\nsomething directive, hovering over them. Of course I mean only the\nSpirit of all Development. Just so, in any embryo, cells that would tend\nto vary from the appearances of their era are compelled to correlate. In _Nature_, 90-169, Charles Tilden Smith writes that, at Chisbury,\nWiltshire, England, early in the decade of the 1910s, he saw something in the sky--\n\n\"--unlike anything that I had ever seen before.\"\n\n\"Although I have studied the skies for many years, I have never seen\nanything like it.\"\n\nHe saw two stationary dark patches upon clouds.

Still the\nDominants are suave very often, or are not absolute gods, and the way\nattention was led away from this subject is an interesting study in\nquasi-divine bamboozlement. Upon page 268, Charles J.P. Cave, the\nmeteorologist, writes that, upon April 5 and 8, at Ditcham Park,\nPetersfield, he had observed a similar appearance, while watching some\npilot balloons--but he describes something not in the least like a\nshadow on clouds, but a stationary cloud--the inference seems to be that\nthe shadows at Chisbury may have been shadows of pilot balloons. Upon\npage 322, another correspondent writes upon shadows cast by mountains;\nupon page 348 someone else carries on the divergence by discussing this\nthird letter: then someone takes up the third letter mathematically; and\nthen there is a correction of error in this mathematic demonstration--I\nthink it looks very much like what I think it looks like. But the mystery here:\n\nThat the dark patches at Chisbury could not have been cast by stationary\npilot balloons that were to the west, or that were between clouds and\nthe setting sun. If, to the west of Chisbury, a stationary object were\nhigh in the air, intercepting the sun's rays, the shadow of the\nstationary object would not have been stationary, but would have moved\nhigher and higher with the setting of the sun. I have to think of something that is in accord with no other data\nwhatsoever:\n\nA luminous body--not the sun--in the sky--but, because of some unknown\nprinciple or atmospheric condition, its light extended down only about\nto the clouds; that from it were suspended two triangular objects, like\nthe object that was seen in Bermuda; that it was this light that fell\nshort of the earth that these objects intercepted; that the objects were\ndrawn up and lowered from something overhead, so that, in its light,\ntheir shadows changed size. If my grope seem to have no grasp in it, and, if a stationary balloon\nwill, in half an hour, not cast a stationary shadow from the setting\nsun, we have to think of two triangular objects that accurately\nmaintained positions in a line between sun and clouds, and at the same\ntime approached and receded from clouds. Whatever it may have been, it's\nenough to make the devout make the sign of the crucible, or whatever the\ndevotees of the Old Dominant do in the presence of a new correlate. Vast, black thing poised like a crow over the moon. It is our acceptance that these two shadows of Chisbury looked, from the\nmoon, like vast things, black as crows, poised over the earth. It is our\nacceptance that two triangular luminosities and then two triangular\npatches, like vast black things, poised like crows over the moon, and,\nlike the triangularities at Chisbury, have been seen upon, or over, the\nmoon:\n\n_Scientific American_, 46-49:\n\nTwo triangular, luminous appearances reported by several observers in\nLebanon, Conn., evening of early in the decade of the 1880s, on the moon's upper limb. They\ndisappeared, and two dark triangular appearances that looked like\nnotches were seen three minutes later upon the lower limb. They\napproached each other, met and instantly disappeared. The merger here is notches that have at times been seen upon the moon's\nlimb: thought to be cross sections of craters (_Monthly Notices,\nR.A.S._, 37-432). But these appearances of early in the decade of the 1880s, were vast upon\nthe moon--\"seemed to be cutting off or obliterating nearly a quarter of\nits surface.\"\n\nSomething else that may have looked like a vast black crow poised over\nthis earth from the moon:\n\n_Monthly Weather Review_, 41-599:\n\nDescription of a shadow in the sky, of some unseen body, in the middle of the decade of the 1910s,\nFort Worth, Texas--supposed to have been cast by an unseen cloud--this\npatch of shade moved with the declining sun. _Rept. Brit. Assoc._, 1854-410:\n\nAccount by two observers of a faint but distinctly triangular object,\nvisible for six nights in the sky. It was observed from two stations\nthat were not far apart.

I should say that relatively to phenomena of light we are in confusion\nas great as some of the discords that orthodoxy is in relatively to\nlight. Broadly and intermediatistically, our position is:\n\nThat light is not really and necessarily light--any more than is\nanything else really and necessarily anything--but an interpretation of\na mode of force, as I suppose we have to call it, as light. At sea\nlevel, the earth's atmosphere interprets sunlight as red or orange or\nyellow. High up on mountains the sun is blue. Very high up on mountains\nthe zenith is black. Or it is orthodoxy to say that in inter-planetary\nspace, where there is no air, there is no light. So then the sun and\ncomets are black, but this earth's atmosphere, or, rather, dust\nparticles in it, interpret radiations from these black objects as light. We look up at the moon. The jet-black moon is so silvery white. I have about fifty notes indicating that the moon has atmosphere:\nnevertheless most astronomers hold out that the moon has no atmosphere. They have to: the theory of eclipses would not work out otherwise. So,\narguing in conventional terms, the moon is black. Rather\nastonishing--explorers upon the moon--stumbling and groping in intense\ndarkness--with telescopes powerful enough, we could see them stumbling\nand groping in brilliant light. Or, just because of familiarity, it is not now obvious to us how the\npreposterousnesses of the old system must have seemed to the correlates\nof the system preceding it. Ye jet-black silvery moon. Altogether, then, it may be conceivable that there are phenomena of\nforce that are interpretable as light as far down as the clouds, but not\nin denser strata of air, or just the opposite of familiar\ninterpretations. I now have some notes upon an occurrence that suggests a force not\ninterpreted by air as light, but interpreted, or reflected by the ground\nas light. I think of something that, for a week, was suspended over\nLondon: of an emanation that was not interpreted as light until it\nreached the ground. _Lancet_, about 1867:\n\nThat every night for a week, a light had appeared in Woburn Square,\nLondon, upon the grass of a small park, enclosed by railings. Crowds\ngathering--police called out \"for the special service of maintaining\norder and making the populace move on.\" The Editor of the _Lancet_ went\nto the Square. He says that he saw nothing but a patch of light falling\nupon an arbor at the northeast corner of the enclosure. Seems to me that\nthat was interesting enough. In this Editor we have a companion for Mr. Symons and Dr. Gray. He\nsuggests that the light came from a street lamp--does not say that he\ncould trace it to any such origin himself--but recommends that the\npolice investigate neighboring street lamps. I'd not say that such a commonplace as light from a street lamp would\nnot attract and excite and deceive great crowds for a week--but I do\naccept that any cop who was called upon for extra work would have needed\nnobody's suggestion to settle that point the very first thing. Or that something in the sky hung suspended over a London Square for a\nweek. _Knowledge_, Dec. 28, 1883:\n\n\"Seeing so many meteorological phenomena in your excellent paper,\n_Knowledge_, I am tempted to ask for an explanation of the following,\nwhich I saw when on board the British India Company's steamer _Patna_,\nwhile on a voyage up the Persian Gulf. In May, 1880, on a dark night,\nabout 11:30 P.M., there suddenly appeared on each side of the ship an\nenormous luminous wheel, whirling around, the spokes of which seemed to\nbrush the ship along. The spokes would be 200 or 300 yards long, and\nresembled the birch rods of the dames' schools. Each wheel contained\nabout sixteen spokes, and, although the wheels must have been some 500\nor 600 yards in diameter, the spokes could be distinctly seen all the\nway round. The phosphorescent gleam seemed to glide along flat on the\nsurface of the sea, no light being visible in the air above the water. The appearance of the spokes could be almost exactly represented by\nstanding in a boat and flashing a bull's eye lantern horizontally along\nthe surface of the water, round and round. I may mention that the\nphenomenon was also seen by Captain Avern, of the _Patna_, and Mr. Manning, third officer. \"Lee Fore Brace. \"P.S.--The wheels advanced along with the ship for about twenty\nminutes.--L.F.B.\"\n\n_Knowledge_, Jan. 11, 1884:\n\nLetter from \"A.

If there's one thing I pride myself upon, it's being able to say\nthat never in my life have I indulged in anything stronger than water.\"\nFrom this curiosity of pride, he goes on to say that he had not intended\nto be exact, but to give his impressions of dimensions and velocity. He\nends amiably: \"However, 'no offense taken, where I suppose none is\nmeant.'\"\n\nTo this letter Mr. Proctor adds a note, apologizing for the publication\nof \"A. Mc. D's.\" letter, which had come about by a misunderstood\ninstruction. Then Mr. Proctor wrote disagreeable letters, himself,\nabout other persons--what else would you expect in a quasi-existence? The obvious explanation of this phenomenon is that, under the surface of\nthe sea, in the Persian Gulf, was a vast luminous wheel: that it was the\nlight from its submerged spokes that Mr. Robertson saw, shining upward. It seems clear that this light did shine upward from origin below the\nsurface of the sea. But at first it is not so clear how vast luminous\nwheels, each the size of a village, ever got under the surface of the\nPersian Gulf: also there may be some misunderstanding as to what they\nwere doing there. A deep-sea fish, and its adaptation to a dense medium--\n\nThat, at least in some regions aloft, there is a medium dense even to\ngelatinousness--\n\nA deep-sea fish, brought to the surface of the ocean: in a relatively\nattenuated medium, it disintegrates--\n\nSuper-constructions adapted to a dense medium in inter-planetary\nspace--sometimes, by stresses of various kinds, they are driven into\nthis earth's thin atmosphere--\n\nLater we shall have data to support just this: that things entering this\nearth's atmosphere disintegrate and shine with a light that is not the\nlight of incandescence: shine brilliantly, even if cold--\n\nVast wheel-like super-constructions--they enter this earth's atmosphere,\nand, threatened with disintegration, plunge for relief into an ocean, or\ninto a denser medium. Of course the requirements now facing us are:\n\nNot only data of vast wheel-like super-constructions that have relieved\ntheir distresses in the ocean, but data of enormous wheels that have\nbeen seen in the air, or entering the ocean, or rising from the ocean\nand continuing their voyages. Very largely we shall concern ourselves with enormous fiery objects that\nhave either plunged into the ocean or risen from the ocean. Our\nacceptance is that, though disruption may intensify into incandescence,\napart from disruption and its probable fieriness, things that enter this\nearth's atmosphere have a cold light which would not, like light from\nmolten matter, be instantly quenched by water. Also it seems acceptable\nthat a revolving wheel would, from a distance, look like a globe; that a\nrevolving wheel, seen relatively close by, looks like a wheel in few\naspects. The mergers of ball-lightning and meteorites are not\nresistances to us: our data are of enormous bodies. So we shall interpret--and what does it matter? Our attitude throughout this book:\n\nThat here are extraordinary data--that they never would be exhumed, and\nnever would be massed together, unless--\n\nHere are the data:\n\nOur first datum is of something that was once seen to enter an ocean. It's from the puritanic publication, _Science_, which has yielded us\nlittle material, or which, like most puritans, does not go upon a spree\nvery often. Whatever the thing could have been, my impression is of\ntremendousness, or of bulk many times that of all meteorites in all\nmuseums combined: also of relative slowness, or of long warning of\napproach. The story, in _Science_, 5-242, is from an account sent to the\nHydrographic Office, at Washington, from the branch office, at San\nFrancisco:\n\nThat, at midnight, Feb. 24, 1885, Lat. 37\u00b0 N., and Long. 170\u00b0 E., or\nsomewhere between Yokohama and Victoria, the captain of the bark\n_Innerwich_ was aroused by his mate, who had seen something unusual in\nthe sky. This must have taken appreciable time. The captain went on deck\nand saw the sky turning fiery red. \"All at once, a large mass of fire\nappeared over the vessel, completely blinding the spectators.\" The fiery\nmass fell into the sea.",

This must have taken appreciable time. The captain went on deck\nand saw the sky turning fiery red. \"All at once, a large mass of fire\nappeared over the vessel, completely blinding the spectators.\" The fiery\nmass fell into the sea. Its size may be judged by the volume of water\ncast up by it, said to have rushed toward the vessel with a noise that\nwas \"deafening.\" The bark was struck flat aback, and \"a roaring, white\nsea passed ahead.\" \"The master, an old, experienced mariner, declared\nthat the awfulness of the sight was beyond description.\"\n\nIn _Nature_, 37-187, and _L'Astronomie_; 1887-76, we are told that an\nobject, described as \"a large ball of fire,\" was seen to rise from the\nsea, near Cape Race. We are told that it rose to a height of fifty feet,\nand then advanced close to the ship, then moving away, remaining visible\nabout five minutes. The supposition in _Nature_ is that it was \"ball\nlightning,\" but Flammarion, _Thunder and Lightning_, p. 68, says that it\nwas enormous. Details in the American _Meteorological Journal_,\n6-443--Nov. 12, 1887--British steamer _Siberian_--that the object had\nmoved \"against the wind\" before retreating--that Captain Moore said that\nat about the same place he had seen such appearances before. _Report of the British Association_, 1861-30:\n\nThat, upon about 1845, according to the _Malta Times_, from the brig\n_Victoria_, about 900 miles east of Adalia, Asia Minor (36\u00b0 40' 56\", N. Lat.: 13\u00b0 44' 36\" E. Long.), three luminous bodies were seen to issue\nfrom the sea, at about half a mile from the vessel. They were visible\nabout ten minutes. The story was never investigated, but other accounts that seem\nacceptably to be other observations upon this same sensational spectacle\ncame in, as if of their own accord, and were published by Prof. Baden-Powell. One is a letter from a correspondent at Mt. Lebanon. He\ndescribes only two luminous bodies. Apparently they were five times the\nsize of the moon: each had appendages, or they were connected by parts\nthat are described as \"sail-like or streamer-like,\" looking like \"large\nflags blown out by a gentle breeze.\" The important point here is not\nonly suggestion of structure, but duration. The duration of meteors is a\nfew seconds: duration of fifteen seconds is remarkable, but I think\nthere are records up to half a minute. This object, if it were all one\nobject, was visible at Mt. Lebanon about one hour. An interesting\ncircumstance is that the appendages did not look like trains of meteors,\nwhich shine by their own light, but \"seemed to shine by light from the\nmain bodies.\"\n\nAbout 900 miles west of the position of the _Victoria_ is the town of\nAdalia, Asia Minor. At about the time of the observation reported by the\ncaptain of the _Victoria_, the Rev. F. Hawlett, F.R.A.S., was in Adalia. He, too, saw this spectacle, and sent an account to Prof. Baden-Powell. In his view it was a body that appeared and then broke up. He places\nduration at twenty minutes to half an hour. In the _Report of the British Association_, 1860-82, the phenomenon was\nreported from Syria and Malta, as two very large bodies \"nearly joined.\"\n\n_Rept. Brit. Assoc._, 1860-77:\n\nThat, at Cherbourg, France, Jan. 12, 1836, was seen a luminous body,\nseemingly two-thirds the size of the moon. It seemed to rotate on an\naxis. Central to it there seemed to be a dark cavity. For other accounts, all indefinite, but distortable into data of\nwheel-like objects in the sky, see _Nature_, 22-617; London _Times_,\nOct. 15, 1859; _Nature_, 21-225; _Monthly Weather Review_, 1883-264. _L'Astronomie_, 1894-157:\n\nThat, upon the morning of Dec. 20, 1893, an appearance in the sky was\nseen by many persons in Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. A\nluminous body passed overhead, from west to east, until at about 15\ndegrees in the eastern horizon, it appeared to stand still for fifteen\nor twenty minutes. According to some descriptions it was the size of a\ntable. To some observers it looked like an enormous wheel. The light was\na brilliant white. Acceptably it was not an optical illusion--the noise\nof its passage through the air was heard. Having been stationary, or\nhaving seemed to stand still fifteen or twenty minutes, it disappeared,\nor exploded. No sound of explosion was heard. Vast wheel-like constructions. They're especially adapted to roll\nthrough a gelatinous medium from planet to planet. Sometimes, because of\nmiscalculations, or because of stresses of various kinds, they enter\nthis earth's atmosphere. They're likely to explode. They have to\nsubmerge in the sea. They stay in the sea awhile, revolving with\nrelative leisureliness, until relieved, and then emerge, sometimes close\nto vessels. Seamen tell of what they see: their reports are interred in\nscientific morgues. I should say that the general route of these\nconstructions is along latitudes not far from the latitudes of the\nPersian Gulf.",

Shaft followed shaft, upon the surface of\nthe sea. But it was only a faint light, and, in about fifteen minutes,\ndied out: having appeared suddenly, having died out gradually. The\nshafts revolved at a velocity of about 60 miles an hour. Phosphorescent jellyfish correlate with the Old Dominant: in one of the\nmost heroic compositions of disregards in our experience, it was agreed,\nin the discussion of Capt. Hoseason's paper, that the phenomenon was\nprobably pulsations of long strings of jellyfish. _Nature_, 21-410:\n\nReprint of a letter from R.E. Harris, Commander of the A.H.N. Co.'s\nsteamship _Shahjehan_, to the Calcutta _Englishman_, Jan. 21, 1880:\n\nThat upon the 5th of June, 1880, off the coast of Malabar, at 10 P.M.,\nwater calm, sky cloudless, he had seen something that was so foreign to\nanything that he had ever seen before, that he had stopped his ship. He\nsaw what he describes as waves of brilliant light, with spaces between. Upon the water were floating patches of a substance that was not\nidentified. Thinking in terms of the conventional explanation of all\nphosphorescence at sea, the captain at first suspected this substance. However, he gives his opinion that it did no illuminating but was, with\nthe rest of the sea, illuminated by tremendous shafts of light. Whether\nit was a thick and oily discharge from the engine of a submerged\nconstruction or not, I think that I shall have to accept this substance\nas a concomitant, because of another note. \"As wave succeeded wave, one\nof the most grand and brilliant, yet solemn, spectacles that one could\nthink of, was here witnessed.\"\n\n_Jour. Roy. Met. Soc._, 32-280:\n\nExtract from a letter from Mr. Douglas Carnegie, Blackheath, England. Date some time in 1906--\n\n\"This last voyage we witnessed a weird and most extraordinary electric\ndisplay.\" In the Gulf of Oman, he saw a bank of apparently quiescent\nphosphorescence: but, when within twenty yards of it, \"shafts of\nbrilliant light came sweeping across the ship's bows at a prodigious\nspeed, which might be put down as anything between 60 and 200 miles an\nhour.\" \"These light bars were about 20 feet apart and most regular.\" As\nto phosphorescence--\"I collected a bucketful of water, and examined it\nunder the microscope, but could not detect anything abnormal.\" That the\nshafts of light came up from something beneath the surface--\"They first\nstruck us on our broadside, and I noticed that an intervening ship had\nno effect on the light beams: they started away from the lee side of the\nship, just as if they had traveled right through it.\"\n\nThe Gulf of Oman is at the entrance to the Persian Gulf. _Jour. Roy. Met. Soc._, 33-294:\n\nExtract from a letter by Mr. S.C. Patterson, second officer of the P. and O. steamship _Delta_: a spectacle which the _Journal_ continues to\ncall phosphorescent:\n\nMalacca Strait, 2 A.M., about 1907:\n\n\"... shafts which seemed to move round a center--like the spokes of a\nwheel--and appeared to be about 300 yards long. The phenomenon lasted\nabout half an hour, during which time the ship had traveled six or seven\nmiles. It stopped suddenly.\"\n\n_L'Astronomie_, 1891-312:\n\nA correspondent writes that, in October, 1891, in the China Sea, he had\nseen shafts or lances of light that had had the appearance of rays of a\nsearchlight, and that had moved like such rays. _Nature_, 20-291:\n\nReport to the Admiralty by Capt. Evans, the Hydrographer of the British\nNavy:\n\nThat Commander J.E. Pringle, of H.M.S. _Vulture_, had reported that, at\nLat. 26\u00b0 26' N., and Long. 53\u00b0 11' E.--in the Persian Gulf--about 1879, he had noticed luminous waves or pulsations in the water, moving\nat great speed. This time we have a definite datum upon origin somewhere\nbelow the surface. It is said that these waves of light passed under the\n_Vulture_. \"On looking toward the east, the appearance was that of a\nrevolving wheel with a center on that bearing, and whose spokes were\nilluminated, and, looking toward the west, a similar wheel appeared to\nbe revolving, but in the opposite direction.\" Or finally as to\nsubmergence--\"These waves of light extended from the surface well under\nthe water.\" It is Commander Pringle's opinion that the shafts\nconstituted one wheel, and that doubling was an illusion.",

He judges the\nshafts to have been about 25 feet broad, and the spaces about 100. Velocity about 84 miles an hour. Duration about 35 minutes. Time 9:40\nP.M. Before and after this display the ship had passed through patches\nof floating substance described as \"oily-looking fish spawn.\"\n\nUpon page 428 of this number of _Nature_, E.L. Moss says that, in April,\n1875, when upon H.M.S. _Bulldog_, a few miles north of Vera Cruz, he had\nseen a series of swift lines of light. He had dipped up some of the\nwater, finding in it animalcule, which would, however, not account for\nphenomena of geometric formation and high velocity. If he means Vera\nCruz, Mexico, this is the only instance we have out of oriental waters. _Scientific American_, 106-51:\n\nThat, in the _Nautical Meteorological Annual_, published by the Danish\nMeteorological Institute, appears a report upon a \"singular phenomenon\"\nthat was seen by Capt. Gabe, of the Danish East Asiatic Co.'s steamship\n_Bintang_. At 3 A.M., about 1909, while sailing through the Straits\nof Malacca, Captain Gabe saw a vast revolving wheel of light, flat upon\nthe water--\"long arms issuing from a center around which the whole\nsystem appeared to rotate.\" So vast was the appearance that only half of\nit could be seen at a time, the center lying near the horizon. This\ndisplay lasted about fifteen minutes. Heretofore we have not been clear\nupon the important point that forward motions of these wheels do not\nsynchronize with a vessel's motions, and freaks of disregard, or,\nrather, commonplaces of disregard, might attempt to assimilate with\nlights of a vessel. This time we are told that the vast wheel moved\nforward, decreasing in brilliancy, and also in speed of rotation,\ndisappearing when the center was right ahead of the vessel--or my own\ninterpretation would be that the source of light was submerging deeper\nand deeper and slowing down because meeting more and more resistance. The Danish Meteorological Institute reports another instance:\n\nThat, when Capt. Breyer, of the Dutch steamer _Valentijn_, was in the\nSouth China Sea, midnight, Aug. 12, 1910, he saw a rotation of flashes. \"It looked like a horizontal wheel, turning rapidly.\" This time it is\nsaid that the appearance was above water. \"The phenomenon was observed\nby the captain, the first and second mates, and the first engineer, and\nupon all of them it made a somewhat uncomfortable impression.\"\n\nIn general, if our expression be not immediately acceptable, we\nrecommend to rival interpreters that they consider the localization--with\none exception--of this phenomenon, to the Indian Ocean and adjacent waters,\nor Persian Gulf on one side and China Sea on the other side. Though we're\nIntermediatists, the call of attempted Positivism, in the aspect of\nCompleteness, is irresistible. We have expressed that from few aspects\nwould wheels of fire in the air look like wheels of fire, but, if we can\nget it, we must have observation upon vast luminous wheels, not\ninterpretable as optical illusions, but enormous, substantial things\nthat have smashed down material resistances, and have been seen to\nplunge into the ocean:\n\n_Athen\u00e6um_, 1848-833:\n\nThat at the meeting of the British Association, 1848, Sir W.S. Harris\nsaid that he had recorded an account sent to him of a vessel toward\nwhich had whirled \"two wheels of fire, which the men described as\nrolling millstones of fire.\" \"When they came near, an awful crash took\nplace: the topmasts were shivered to pieces.\" It is said that there was\na strong sulphurous odor. _Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society_, 1-157:\n\nExtract from the log of the bark _Lady of the Lake_, by Capt. F.W. Banner:\n\nCommunicated by R.H. Scott, F.R.S.:\n\nThat, upon the 22nd of March, 1870, at Lat. 5\u00b0 47' N., Long. 27\u00b0 52' W.,\nthe sailors of the _Lady of the Lake_ saw a remarkable object, or\n\"cloud,\" in the sky. They reported to the captain. According to Capt. Banner, it was a cloud of circular form, with an\nincluded semi-circle divided into four parts, the central dividing shaft\nbeginning at the center of the circle and extending far outward, and\nthen curving backward. Geometricity and complexity and stability of form: and the small\nlikelihood of a cloud maintaining such diversity of features, to say\nnothing of appearance of organic form. The thing traveled from a point at about 20 degrees above the horizon to\na point about 80 degrees above. Then it settled down to the northeast,\nhaving appeared from the south, southeast. Light gray in color, or it was cloud-color. \"It was much lower than the other clouds.\"\n\nAnd this datum stands out:\n\nThat, whatever it may have been, it traveled against the wind. \"It came up obliquely against the wind, and finally settled down right\nin the wind's eye.\"\n\nFor half an hour this form was visible.",

When it did finally disappear\nthat was not because it disintegrated like a cloud, but because it was\nlost to sight in the evening darkness. Capt. Banner draws the following diagram:\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\nText-books tell us that the Dhurmsalla meteorites were picked up \"soon,\"\nor \"within half an hour.\" Given a little time the conventionalists may\nargue that these stones were hot when they fell, but that their great\ninterior coldness had overcome the molten state of their surfaces. According to the Deputy Commissioner of Dhurmsalla, these stones had\nbeen picked up \"immediately\" by passing coolies. These stones were so cold that they benumbed the fingers. But they had\nfallen with a great light. It is described as \"a flame of fire about\ntwo feet in depth and nine feet in length.\" Acceptably this light was\nnot the light of molten matter. In this chapter we are very intermediatistic--and unsatisfactory. To the\nintermediatist there is but one answer to all questions:\n\nSometimes and sometimes not. Another form of this intermediatist \"solution\" of all problems is:\n\nYes and no. Everything that is, also isn't. A positivist attempts to formulate: so does the intermediatist, but with\nless rigorousness: he accepts but also denies: he may seem to accept in\none respect and deny in some other respect, but no real line can be\ndrawn between any two aspects of anything. The intermediatist accepts\nthat which seems to correlate with something that he has accepted as a\ndominant. The positivist correlates with a belief. In the Dhurmsalla meteorites we have support for our expression that\nthings entering this earth's atmosphere sometimes shine with a light\nthat is not the light of incandescence--or so we account, or offer an\nexpression upon, \"thunderstones,\" or carved stones that have fallen\nluminously to this earth, in streaks that have looked like strokes of\nlightning--but we accept, also, that some things that have entered this\nearth's atmosphere, disintegrate with the intensity of flame and molten\nmatter--but some things, we accept, enter this earth's atmosphere and\ncollapse non-luminously, quite like deep-sea fishes brought to the\nsurface of the ocean. Whatever agreement we have is an indication that\nsomewhere aloft there is a medium denser than this earth's atmosphere. I\nsuppose our stronghold is in that such is not popular belief--\n\nOr the rhythm of all phenomena:\n\nAir dense at sea level upon this earth--less and less dense as one\nascends--then denser and denser. A good many bothersome questions\narise--\n\nOur attitude:\n\nHere are the data:\n\nLuminous rains sometimes fall (_Nature_, about 1882; _Nature_,\n25-437). This is light that is not the light of incandescence, but no\none can say that these occasional, or rare, rains come from this\nearth's externality. We simply note cold light of falling bodies. For\nluminous rain, snow, and dust, see Hartwig, _Aerial World_, p. 319. As\nto luminous clouds, we have more nearly definite observations and\nopinions: they mark transition between the Old Dominant and the New\nDominant. We have already noted the transition in Prof. Schwedoffs\ntheory of external origin of some hailstones--and the implications that,\nto a former generation, seemed so preposterous--\"droll\" was the\nword--that there are in inter-planetary regions volumes of\nwater--whether they have fishes and frogs in them or not. Now our\nacceptance is that clouds sometimes come from external regions, having\nhad origin from super-geographical lakes and oceans that we shall not\nattempt to chart, just at present--only suggesting to enterprising\naviators--and we note that we put it all up to them, and show no\ninclination to go Columbusing on our own account--that they take bathing\nsuits, or, rather, deep-sea diving-suits along. So then that some clouds\ncome from inter-planetary oceans--of the Super-Sargasso Sea--if we still\naccept the Super-Sargasso Sea--and shine, upon entering this earth's\natmosphere. In _Himmel und Erde_, February, 1889--a phenomenon of\ntransition of thirty years ago--Herr O. Jesse, in his observations upon\nluminous night-clouds, notes the great height of them, and drolly or\nsensibly suggests that some of them may have come from regions external\nto this earth. I suppose he means only from other planets. But it's a\nvery droll and sensible idea either way. In general I am accounting for a great deal of this earth's isolation:\nthat it is relatively isolated by circumstances that are similar to the\ncircumstances that make for relative isolation of the bottom of the\nocean--except that there is a clumsiness of analogy now.",

    "text": "Now our\nacceptance is that clouds sometimes come from external regions, having\nhad origin from super-geographical lakes and oceans that we shall not\nattempt to chart, just at present--only suggesting to enterprising\naviators--and we note that we put it all up to them, and show no\ninclination to go Columbusing on our own account--that they take bathing\nsuits, or, rather, deep-sea diving-suits along. So then that some clouds\ncome from inter-planetary oceans--of the Super-Sargasso Sea--if we still\naccept the Super-Sargasso Sea--and shine, upon entering this earth's\natmosphere. In _Himmel und Erde_, February, 1889--a phenomenon of\ntransition of thirty years ago--Herr O. Jesse, in his observations upon\nluminous night-clouds, notes the great height of them, and drolly or\nsensibly suggests that some of them may have come from regions external\nto this earth. I suppose he means only from other planets. But it's a\nvery droll and sensible idea either way. In general I am accounting for a great deal of this earth's isolation:\nthat it is relatively isolated by circumstances that are similar to the\ncircumstances that make for relative isolation of the bottom of the\nocean--except that there is a clumsiness of analogy now. To call\nourselves deep-sea fishes has been convenient, but, in a\nquasi-existence, there is no convenience that will not sooner or later\nturn awkward--so, if there be denser regions aloft, these regions should\nnow be regarded as analogues of far-submerged oceanic regions, and\nthings coming to this earth would be like things rising to an attenuated\nmedium--and exploding--sometimes incandescently, sometimes with cold\nlight--sometimes non-luminously, like deep-sea fishes brought to the\nsurface--altogether conditions of inhospitality. I have a suspicion\nthat, in their own depths, deep-sea fishes are not luminous. If they\nare, Darwinism is mere jesuitism, in attempting to correlate them. Such\nadvertising would so attract attention that all advantages would be more\nthan offset. Darwinism is largely a doctrine of concealment: here we\nhave brazen proclamation--if accepted. Fishes in the Mammoth Cave need\nno light to see by. We might have an expression that deep-sea fishes\nturn luminous upon entering a less dense medium--but models in the\nAmerican Museum of Natural History: specialized organs of luminosity\nupon these models. Of course we do remember that awfully convincing\n\"dodo,\" and some of our sophistications we trace to him--at any rate\ndisruption is regarded as a phenomenon of coming from a dense to a less\ndense medium. An account by M. Acharius, in the _Transactions of the Swedish Academy\nof Sciences_, 1808-215, translated for the _North American Review_,\n3-319:\n\nThat M. Acharius, having heard of \"an extraordinary and probably\nhitherto unseen phenomenon,\" reported from near the town of Skeninge,\nSweden, investigated:\n\nThat, upon the 16th of May, 1808, at about 4 P.M., the sun suddenly\nturned dull brick-red. At the same time there appeared, upon the western\nhorizon, a great number of round bodies, dark brown, and seemingly the\nsize of a hat crown. They passed overhead and disappeared in the eastern\nhorizon. Tremendous procession. It lasted two hours. Occasionally one\nfell to the ground. When the place of a fall was examined, there was\nfound a film, which soon dried and vanished. Often, when approaching the\nsun, these bodies seemed to link together, or were then seen to be\nlinked together, in groups not exceeding eight, and, under the sun, they\nwere seen to have tails three or four fathoms long. Away from the sun\nthe tails were invisible. Whatever their substance may have been, it is\ndescribed as gelatinous--\"soapy and jellied.\"\n\nI place this datum here for several reasons. It would have been a good\nclimax to our expression upon hordes of small bodies that, in our\nacceptance, were not seeds, nor birds, nor ice-crystals: but the\ntendency would have been to jump to the homogeneous conclusion that all\nour data in that expression related to this one kind of phenomena,\nwhereas we conceive of infinite heterogeneity of the external: of\ncrusaders and rabbles and emigrants and tourists and dragons and things\nlike gelatinous hat crowns. Or that all things, here, upon this earth,\nthat flock together, are not necessarily sheep, Presbyterians,\ngangsters, or porpoises. The datum is important to us, here, as\nindication of disruption in this earth's atmosphere--dangers in entering\nthis earth's atmosphere. I think, myself, that thousands of objects have been seen to fall from\naloft, and have exploded luminously, and have been called \"ball\nlightning.\"\n\n\"As to what ball lightning is, we have not yet begun to make intelligent\nguesses.\" (_Monthly Weather Review_, 34-17.)\n\nIn general, it seems to me that when we encounter the opposition \"ball\nlightning\" we should pay little attention, but confine ourselves to\nguesses that are at least intelligent, that stand phantom-like in our\nway. We note here that in some of our acceptances upon intelligence we\nshould more clearly have pointed out that they were upon the intelligent\nas opposed to the instinctive. In the _Monthly Weather Review_, 33-409,\nthere is an account of \"ball lightning\" that struck a tree. It made a\ndent such as a falling object would make. Some other time I shall\ncollect instances of \"ball lightning,\" to express that they are\ninstances of objects that have fallen from the sky, luminously,\nexploding terrifically. So bewildered is the old orthodoxy by these\nphenomena that many scientists have either denied \"ball lightning\" or\nhave considered it very doubtful. I refer to Dr. Sestier's list of one\nhundred and fifty instances, which he considered authentic. In accord with our disaccord is an instance related in the _Monthly\nWeather Review_, March, 1887--something that fell luminously from the\nsky, accompanied by something that was not so affected, or that was\ndark:\n\nThat, according to Capt. C.D. Sweet, of the Dutch bark, _J.P.A._, upon\nlate in the decade of the 1880s, N. 37\u00b0 39', W. 57\u00b0 00', he encountered a severe storm. He saw two objects in the air above the ship. One was luminous, and\nmight be explained in several ways, but the other was dark.",

One was luminous, and\nmight be explained in several ways, but the other was dark. One or both\nfell into the sea, with a roar and the casting up of billows. It is our\nacceptance that these things had entered this earth's atmosphere,\nhaving first crashed through a field of ice--\"immediately afterward\nlumps of ice fell.\"\n\nOne of the most astonishing of the phenomena of \"ball lightning\" is a\nphenomenon of many meteorites: violence of explosion out of all\nproportion to size and velocity. We accept that the icy meteorites of\nDhurmsalla could have fallen with no great velocity, but the sound from\nthem was tremendous. The soft substance that fell at the Cape of Good\nHope was carbonaceous, but was unburned, or had fallen with velocity\ninsufficient to ignite it. The tremendous report that it made was heard\nover an area more than seventy miles in diameter. That some hailstones have been formed in a dense medium, and violently\ndisintegrate in this earth's relatively thin atmosphere:\n\n_Nature_, 88-350:\n\nLarge hailstones noted at the University of Missouri, Nov. 11, 1911:\nthey exploded with sounds like pistol shots. The writer says that he had\nnoticed a similar phenomenon, eighteen years before, at Lexington,\nKentucky. Hailstones that seemed to have been formed in a denser medium:\nwhen melted under water they gave out bubbles larger than their central\nair spaces. (_Monthly Weather Review_, 33-445.)\n\nOur acceptance is that many objects have fallen from the sky, but that\nmany of them have disintegrated violently. This acceptance will\nco-ordinate with data still to come, but, also, we make it easy for\nourselves in our expressions upon super-constructions, if we're asked\nwhy, from thinkable wrecks of them, girders, plates, or parts\nrecognizably of manufactured metal have not fallen from the sky. However, as to composition, we have not this refuge, so it is our\nexpression that there have been reported instances of the fall of\nmanufactured metal from the sky. The meteorite of Rutherford, North Carolina, is of artificial material:\nmass of pig iron. It is said to be fraudulent. (_Amer. Jour. Sci._,\n2-34-298.)\n\nThe object that was said to have fallen at Marblehead, Mass., in 1858,\nis described in the _Amer. Jour. Sci._, 2-34-135, as \"a furnace product,\nformed in smelting copper ores, or iron ores containing copper.\" It is\nsaid to be fraudulent. According to Ehrenberg, the substance reported by Capt. Callam to have\nfallen upon his vessel, near Java, \"offered complete resemblance to the\nresidue resulting from combustion of a steel wire in a flask of oxygen.\"\n(Zurcher, _Meteors_, p. 239.) _Nature_, Nov. 21, 1878, publishes a\nnotice that, according to the _Yuma Sentinel_, a meteorite that\n\"resembles steel\" had been found in the Mohave Desert. In _Nature_, Feb. 15, 1894, we read that one of the meteorites brought to the United\nStates by Peary, from Greenland, is of tempered steel. The opinion is\nthat meteoric iron had fallen in water or snow, quickly cooling and\nhardening. This does not apply to composition. Nov. 5, 1898, _Nature_\npublishes a notice of a paper by Prof. Berwerth, of Vienna, upon \"the\nclose connection between meteoric iron and steel-works' steel.\"\n\nAt the meeting of Nov. 24, 1906, of the Essex Field Club, was exhibited\na piece of metal said to have fallen from the sky, Oct. 9, 1906, at\nBraintree. According to the _Essex Naturalist_, Dr. Fletcher, of the\nBritish Museum, had declared this metal to be smelted iron--\"so that the\nmystery of its reported 'fall' remained unexplained.\"\n\n\nWe shall have an outcry of silences. If a single instance of anything be\ndisregarded by a System--our own attitude is that a single instance is a\npowerless thing. Of course our own method of agreement of many instances\nis not a real method. In Continuity, all things must have resemblances\nwith all other things. Anything has any quasi-identity you please. Some\ntime ago conscription was assimilated with either autocracy or democracy\nwith equal facility. Note the need for a dominant to correlate to. Scarcely anybody said simply that we must have conscription: but that we\nmust have conscription, which correlates with democracy, which was taken\nas a base, or something basically desirable. Of course between autocracy\nand democracy nothing but false demarcation can be drawn. So I can\nconceive of no subject upon which there should be such poverty as a\nsingle instance, if anything one pleases can be whipped into line. However, we shall try to be more nearly real than the Darwinites who\nadvance concealing coloration as Darwinism, and then drag in proclaiming\nluminosity, too, as Darwinism. I think the Darwinites had better come in\nwith us as to the deep-sea fishes--and be sorry later, I suppose. It\nwill be amazing or negligible to read all the instances now to come of\nthings that have been seen in the sky, and to think that all have been\ndisregarded.",

My own opinion is that it is not possible, or very easy, to\ndisregard them, now that they have been brought together--but that, if\nprior to about this time we had attempted such an assemblage, the Old\nDominant would have withered our typewriter--as it is the letter \"e\" has\ngone back on us, and the \"s\" is temperamental. \"Most extraordinary and singular phenomenon,\" North Wales, Aug. 26,\n1894; a disk from which projected an orange-colored body that looked\nlike \"an elongated flatfish,\" reported by Admiral Ommanney (_Nature_,\n50-524); disk from which projected a hook-like form, India, about 1838;\ndiagram of it given; disk about size of the moon, but brighter than the\nmoon; visible about twenty minutes; by G.

I think that with the object known as Eddie's \"comet\" passes away the\nlast of our susceptibility to the common fallacy of personifying. It is\none of the most deep-rooted of positivist illusions--that people are\npersons. We have been guilty too often of spleens and spites and\nridicules against astronomers, as if they were persons, or final\nunities, individuals, completenesses, or selves--instead of\nindeterminate parts. But, so long as we remain in quasi-existence, we\ncan cast out illusion only with some other illusion, though the other\nillusion may approximate higher to reality. So we personify no more--but\nwe super-personify. We now take into full acceptance our expression that\nDevelopment is an Autocracy of Successive Dominants--which are not\nfinal--but which approximate higher to individuality or self-ness, than\ndo the human tropisms that irresponsibly correlate to them. Eddie reported a celestial object, from the Observatory at Grahamstown,\nSouth Africa. It was in 1890. The New Dominant was only heir presumptive\nthen, or heir apparent but not obvious.

The Dominants are jealous gods. In _Nature_, presumably a vassal of the new god, though of course also\nplausibly rendering homage to the old, is reported a comet-like body, of\nOct. 27, 1890, observed at Grahamstown, by Eddie. It may have looked\ncomet-like, but it moved 100 degrees while visible, or one hundred\ndegrees in three-quarters of an hour. See _Nature_, 43-89, 90. In _Nature_, 44-519, Prof. Copeland describes a similar appearance that\nhe had seen, Sept. 10, 1891. Dreyer says (_Nature_, 44-541) that he had\nseen this object at the Armagh Observatory. He likens it to the object\nthat was reported by Eddie. It was seen by Dr. Alexander Graham Bell,\nSept. 11, 1891, in Nova Scotia. But the Old Dominant was a jealous god. So there were different observations upon something that was seen in\nNovember, 1883. These observations were Philistines in 1883. In the\n_Amer. Met. Jour._, 1-110, a correspondent reports having seen an object\nlike a comet, with two tails, one up and one down, Nov. 10 or 12, 1883. Very likely this phenomenon should be placed in our expression upon\ntorpedo-shaped bodies that have been seen in the sky--our data upon\ndirigibles, or super-Zeppelins--but our attempted classifications are\nfar from rigorous--or are mere gropes. In the _Scientific American_,\n50-40, a correspondent writes from Humacao, Porto Rico, that, Nov. 21,\n1883, he and several other--persons--or persons, as it were--had seen a\nmajestic appearance, like a comet. Visible three successive nights:\ndisappeared then. The Editor says that he can offer no explanation. If\naccepted, this thing must have been close to the earth. If it had been a\ncomet, it would have been seen widely, and the news would have been\ntelegraphed over the world, says the Editor. Upon page 97 of this volume\nof the _Scientific American_, a correspondent writes that, at Sulphur\nSprings, Ohio, he had seen \"a wonder in the sky,\" at about the same\ndate. It was torpedo-shaped, or something with a nucleus, at each end of\nwhich was a tail. Again the Editor says that he can offer no\nexplanation: that the object was not a comet. He associates it with the\natmospheric effects general in 1883. But it will be our expression that,\nin England and Holland, a similar object was seen in November, 1882. In the _Scientific American_, 40-294, is published a letter from Henry\nHarrison, of Jersey City, copied from the _New York Tribune_: that upon\nthe evening of about 1870s, Mr. Harrison was searching for Brorsen's\ncomet, when he saw an object that was moving so rapidly that it could\nnot have been a comet. He called a friend to look, and his observation\nwas confirmed. At two o'clock in the morning this object was still\nvisible. In the _Scientific American Supplement_, 7-2885, Mr. Harrison\ndisclaims sensationalism, which he seems to think unworthy, and gives\ntechnical details: he says that the object was seen by Mr. J. Spencer\nDevoe, of Manhattanville. \"A formation having the shape of a dirigible.\" It was reported from\nHuntington, West Virginia (_Sci. Amer._, 115-241). Luminous object that\nwas seen about 1916, at about 11 P.M. Observed through \"rather\npowerful field glasses,\" it looked to be about two degrees long and half\na degree wide. It gradually dimmed, disappeared, reappeared, and then\nfaded out of sight. Another person--as we say: it would be too\ninconvenient to hold to our intermediatist recognitions--another person\nwho observed this phenomenon suggested to the writer of the account\nthat the object was a dirigible, but the writer says that faint stars\ncould be seen behind it. This would seem really to oppose our notion of\na dirigible visitor to this earth--except for the inconclusiveness of\nall things in a mode of seeming that is not final--or we suggest that\nbehind some parts of the object, thing, construction, faint stars were\nseen. We find a slight discussion here. Prof. H.M. Russell thinks that\nthe phenomenon was a detached cloud of aurora borealis. Upon page 369 of\nthis volume of the _Scientific American_, another correlator suggests\nthat it was a light from a blast furnace--disregarding that, if there be\nblast furnaces in or near Huntington, their reflections would be\ncommonplaces there. We now have several observations upon cylindrical-shaped bodies that\nhave appeared in this earth's atmosphere: cylindrical, but pointed at\nboth ends, or torpedo-shaped. Some of the accounts are not very\ndetailed, but out of the bits of description my own acceptance is that\nsuper-geographical routes are traversed by torpedo-shaped\nsuper-constructions that have occasionally visited, or that have\noccasionally been driven into this earth's atmosphere.",

From data, the\nacceptance is that upon entering this earth's atmosphere, these vessels\nhave been so racked that had they not sailed away, disintegration would\nhave occurred: that, before leaving this earth, they have, whether in\nattempted communication or not, or in mere wantonness or not, dropped\nobjects, which did almost immediately violently disintegrate or explode. Upon general principles we think that explosives have not been purposely\ndropped, but that parts have been racked off, and have fallen, exploding\nlike the things called \"ball lightning.\" Many have been objects of stone\nor metal with inscriptions upon them, for all we know, at present. In\nall instances, estimates of dimensions are valueless, but ratios of\ndimensions are more acceptable. A thing said to have been six feet long\nmay have been six hundred feet long; but shape is not so subject to the\nillusions of distance. _Nature_, 40-415:\n\nThat, Aug. 5, 1889, during a violent storm, an object that looked to be\nabout 15 inches long and 5 inches wide, fell, rather slowly, at East\nTwickenham, England. It exploded. No substance from it was found. _L'Ann\u00e9e Scientifique_, 1864-54:\n\nThat, Oct. 10, 1864, M. Leverrier had sent to the Academy three letters\nfrom witnesses of a long luminous body, tapering at both ends, that had\nbeen seen in the sky. In _Thunder and Lightning_, p. 87, Flammarion says that on Aug. 20,\n1880, during a rather violent storm, M.A. Tr\u00e9cul, of the French Academy,\nsaw a very brilliant yellowish-white body, apparently 35 to 40\ncentimeters long, and about 25 centimeters wide. Torpedo-shaped. Or a\ncylindrical body, \"with slightly conical ends.\" It dropped something,\nand disappeared in the clouds. Whatever it may have been that was\ndropped, it fell vertically, like a heavy object, and left a luminous\ntrain. The scene of this occurrence may have been far from the observer. No sound was heard. For M. Tr\u00e9cul's account, see _Comptes Rendus_,\n103-849. _Monthly Weather Review_, 1907-310:\n\nThat, late in the decade of the 1900s, in the town of Burlington, Vermont, a terrific\nexplosion had been heard throughout the city. A ball of light, or a\nluminous object, had been seen to fall from the sky--or from a\ntorpedo-shaped thing, or construction, in the sky. No one had seen this\nthing that had exploded fall from a larger body that was in the sky--but\nif we accept that at the same time there was a larger body in the sky--\n\nMy own acceptance is that a dirigible in the sky, or a construction that\nshowed every sign of disrupting, had barely time to drop--whatever it\ndid drop--and to speed away to safety above. The following story is told, in the _Review_, by Bishop John S. Michaud:\n\n\"I was standing on the corner of Church and College Streets, just in\nfront of the Howard Bank, and facing east, engaged in conversation with\nEx-Governor Woodbury and Mr. A.A. Buell, when, without the slightest\nindication, or warning, we were startled by what sounded like a most\nunusual and terrific explosion, evidently very nearby. Raising my eyes,\nand looking eastward along College Street, I observed a torpedo-shaped\nbody, some 300 feet away, stationary in appearance, and suspended in the\nair, about 50 feet above the tops of the buildings. In size it was about\n6 feet long by 8 inches in diameter, the shell, or covering, having a\ndark appearance, with here and there tongues of fire issuing from spots\non the surface, resembling red-hot, unburnished copper. Although\nstationary when first noticed, this object soon began to move, rather\nslowly, and disappeared over Dolan Brothers' store, southward. As it\nmoved, the covering seemed rupturing in places, and through these the\nintensely red flames issued.\"\n\nBishop Michaud attempts to correlate it with meteorological\nobservations. Because of the nearby view this is perhaps the most remarkable of the\nnew correlates, but the correlate now coming is extraordinary because of\nthe great number of recorded observations upon it. My own acceptance is\nthat, upon Nov. 17, 1882, a vast dirigible crossed England, but by the\ndefiniteness-indefiniteness of all things quasi-real, some observations\nupon it can be correlated with anything one pleases. E.W. Maunder, invited by the Editors of the _Observatory_ to write some\nreminiscences for the 500th number of their magazine, gives one that he\nsays stands out (_Observatory_, 39-214). It is upon something that he\nterms \"a strange celestial visitor.\" Maunder was at the Royal\nObservatory, Greenwich, Nov. 17, 1882, at night. There was an aurora,\nwithout features of special interest. In the midst of the aurora, a\ngreat circular disk of greenish light appeared and moved smoothly across\nthe sky. But the circularity was evidently the effect of foreshortening. The thing passed above the moon, and was, by other observers, described\nas \"cigar-shaped,\" \"like a torpedo,\" \"a spindle,\" \"a shuttle.\" The idea\nof foreshortening is not mine: Maunder says this.",

He says: \"Had the\nincident occurred a third of a century later, beyond doubt everyone\nwould have selected the same simile--it would have been 'just like a\nZeppelin.'\" The duration was about two minutes. Color said to have been\nthe same as that of the auroral glow in the north. Nevertheless, Maunder\nsays that this thing had no relation to auroral phenomena. \"It appeared\nto be a definite body.\" Motion too fast for a cloud, but \"nothing could\nbe more unlike the rush of a meteor.\" In the _Philosophical Magazine_,\n5-15-318, J. Rand Capron, in a lengthy paper, alludes throughout to this\nphenomenon as an \"auroral beam,\" but he lists many observations upon\nits \"torpedo-shape,\" and one observation upon a \"dark nucleus\" in\nit--host of most confusing observations--estimates of height between 40\nand 200 miles--observations in Holland and Belgium. We are told that\naccording to Capron's spectroscopic observations the phenomenon was\nnothing but a beam of auroral light. In the _Observatory_, 6-192, is\nMaunder's contemporaneous account. He gives apparent approximate length\nand breadth at twenty-seven degrees and three degrees and a half. He\ngives other observations seeming to indicate structure--\"remarkable dark\nmarking down the center.\"\n\nIn _Nature_, 27-84, Capron says that because of the moonlight he had\nbeen able to do little with the spectroscope. Color white, but aurora rosy (_Nature_, 27-87). Bright stars seen through it, but not at the zenith, where it looked\nopaque. This is the only assertion of transparency (_Nature_, 27-87). Too slow for a meteor, but too fast for a cloud (_Nature_, 27-86). \"Surface had a mottled appearance\" (_Nature_, 27-87). \"Very definite in\nform, like a torpedo\" (_Nature_, 27-100). \"Probably a meteoric object\"\n(Dr. Groneman, _Nature_, 27-296). Technical demonstration by Dr. Groneman, that it was a cloud of meteoric matter (_Nature_, 28-105). See\n_Nature_, 27-315, 338, 365, 388, 412, 434. \"Very little doubt it was an electric phenomenon\" (Proctor, _Knowledge_,\n2-419). In the London _Times_, Nov. 20, 1882, the Editor says that he had\nreceived a great number of letters upon this phenomenon. He publishes\ntwo. One correspondent describes it as \"well-defined and shaped like a\nfish... extraordinary and alarming.\" The other correspondent writes of\nit as \"a most magnificent luminous mass, shaped somewhat like a\ntorpedo.\"\n\n\n_Notes and Queries_, 5-3-306:\n\nAbout 8 lights that were seen in Wales, over an area of about 8 miles,\nall keeping their own ground, whether moving together perpendicularly,\nhorizontally, or over a zigzag course. They looked like electric\nlights--disappearing, reappearing dimly, then shining as bright as ever. \"We have seen them three or four at a time afterward, on four or five\noccasions.\"\n\nLondon _Times_, Oct. 5, 1877:\n\n\"From time to time the west coast of Wales seems to have been the scene\nof mysterious lights.... And now we have a statement from Towyn that\nwithin the last few weeks lights of various colors have been seen moving\nover the estuary of the Dysynni River, and out to sea. They are\ngenerally in a northerly direction, but sometimes they hug the shore,\nand move at high velocity for miles toward Aberdovey, and suddenly\ndisappear.\"\n\n_L'Ann\u00e9e Scientifique_, 1877-45:\n\nLights that appeared in the sky, above Vence, France, about 1877;\ndescribed as balls of fire of dazzling brightness; appeared from a cloud\nabout a degree in diameter; moved relatively slowly. They were visible\nmore than an hour, moving northward. It is said that eight or ten years\nbefore similar lights or objects had been seen in the sky, at Vence. London _Times_, Sept. 19, 1848:\n\nThat, at Inverness, Scotland, two large, bright lights that looked like\nstars had been seen in the sky: sometimes stationary, but occasionally\nmoving at high velocity. _L'Ann\u00e9e Scientifique_, 1888-66:\n\nObserved near St. Petersburg, about 1880, in the evening: a large\nspherical light and two smaller ones, moving along a ravine: visible\nthree minutes; disappearing without noise. _Nature_, 35-173:\n\nThat, at Yloilo, Sept. 30, 1886, was seen a luminous object the size of\nthe full moon.

There was an investigation. Before a commission, headed by\nAdmiral Collinson, testimony was taken. One witness described the light\nthat had deceived him as \"considerably elevated above ground.\" No\nconclusion was reached: the lights were called \"the mysterious lights.\"\nBut whatever the \"false lights of Durham\" may have been, they were\nunaffected by the investigation. In 1867, the Tyne Pilotage Board took\nthe matter up. Opinion of the Mayor of Tyne--\"a mysterious affair.\"\n\nIn the _Report of the British Association_, 1877-152, there is a\ndescription of a group of \"meteors\" that traveled with \"remarkable\nslowness.\" They were in sight about three minutes. \"Remarkable,\" it\nseems, is scarcely strong enough: one reads of \"remarkable\" as applied\nto a duration of three seconds. These \"meteors\" had another peculiarity;\nthey left no train. They are described as \"seemingly huddled together\nlike a flock of wild geese, and moving with the same velocity and grace\nof regularity.\"\n\n_Jour. Roy. Astro. Soc. of Canada_, November and December, 1913:\n\nThat, according to many observations collected by Prof. Chant, of\nToronto, there appeared, upon the night of Feb. 9, 1913, a spectacle\nthat was seen in Canada, the United States, and at sea, and in Bermuda. A luminous body was seen. To it there was a long tail. The body grew\nrapidly larger. \"Observers differ as to whether the body was single, or\nwas composed of three or four parts, with a tail to each part.\" The\ngroup, or complex structure, moved with \"a peculiar, majestic\ndeliberation.\" \"It disappeared in the distance, and another group\nemerged from its place of origin. Onward they moved, at the same\ndeliberate pace, in twos or threes or fours.\" They disappeared. A third\ngroup, or a third structure, followed. Some observers compared the spectacle to a fleet of airships: others to\nbattleships attended by cruisers and destroyers. According to one writer:\n\n\"There were probably 30 or 32 bodies, and the peculiar thing about them\nwas their moving in fours and threes and twos, abreast of one another;\nand so perfect was the lining up that you would have thought it was an\naerial fleet maneuvering after rigid drilling.\"\n\n_Nature_, in the middle of the decade of the 1890s:\n\nA letter from Capt. Charles J. Norcock, of H.M.S. _Caroline_:\n\nThat, upon the 24th of February, 1893, at 10 P.M., between Shanghai and\nJapan, the officer of the watch had reported \"some unusual lights.\"\n\nThey were between the ship and a mountain. The mountain was about 6,000\nfeet high. The lights seemed to be globular. They moved sometimes\nmassed, but sometimes strung out in an irregular line. They bore\n\"northward,\" until lost to sight. Duration two hours. The next night the lights were seen again. They were, for a time, eclipsed by a small island. They bore north at\nabout the same speed and in about the same direction as speed and\ndirection of the _Caroline_. But they were lights that cast a\nreflection: there was a glare upon the horizon under them. A telescope\nbrought out but few details: that they were reddish, and seemed to emit\na faint smoke. This time the duration was seven and a half hours. Then Capt. Norcock says that, in the same general locality, and at about\nthe same time, Capt. Castle, of H.M.S. _Leander_, had seen lights. He\nhad altered his course and had made toward them. The lights had fled\nfrom him. At least, they had moved higher in the sky. _Monthly Weather Review_, March, 1904-115:\n\nReport from the observations of three members of his crew by Lieut. Frank H. Schofield, U.S.N, of the U.S.S. _Supply_:\n\nFeb. 24, 1904. Three luminous objects, of different sizes, the largest\nhaving an apparent area of about six suns. When first sighted, they were\nnot very high. They were below clouds of an estimated height of about\none mile. They fled, or they evaded, or they turned. They went up into the clouds below which they had, at first, been\nsighted. Their unison of movement. But they were of different sizes, and of different susceptibilities to\nall forces of this earth and of the air. _Monthly Weather Review_, August, 1898-358:\n\nTwo letters from C.N. Crotsenburg, Crow Agency, Montana:\n\nThat, in the summer of 1896, when this writer was a railroad postal\nclerk--or one who was experienced in train-phenomena--while his train\nwas going \"northward,\" from Trenton, Mo., he and another clerk saw, in\nthe darkness of a heavy rain, a light that appeared to be round, and of\na dull-rose color, and seemed to be about a foot in diameter. It seemed\nto float within a hundred feet of the earth, but soon rose high, or\n\"midway between horizon and zenith.\" The wind was quite strong from the\neast, but the light held a course almost due north. Its speed varied.",

Its speed varied. Sometimes it seemed to outrun the train\n\"considerably.\" At other times it seemed to fall behind. The mail-clerks\nwatched until the town of Linville, Iowa, was reached. Behind the depot\nof this town, the light disappeared, and was not seen again. All this\ntime there had been rain, but very little lightning, but Mr. Crotsenburg\noffers the explanation that it was \"ball lightning.\"\n\nThe Editor of the _Review_ disagrees. He thinks that the light may have\nbeen a reflection from the rain, or fog, or from leaves of trees,\nglistening with rain, or the train's light--not lights. In the December number of the _Review_ is a letter from Edward M. Boggs--that the light was a reflection, perhaps, from the glare--one\nlight, this time--from the locomotive's fire-box, upon wet telegraph\nwires--an appearance that might not be striated by the wires, but\nconsolidated into one rotundity--that it had seemed to oscillate with\nthe undulations of the wires, and had seemed to change horizontal\ndistance with the varying angles of reflection, and had seemed to\nadvance or fall behind, when the train had rounded curves. All of which is typical of the best of quasi-reasoning. It includes and\nassimilates diverse data: but it excludes that which will destroy it:\n\nThat, acceptably, the telegraph wires were alongside the track beyond,\nas well as leading to Linville. Mr. Crotsenburg thinks of \"ball lightning,\" which, though a sore\nbewilderment to most speculation, is usually supposed to be a correlate\nwith the old system of thought: but his awareness of \"something else\" is\nexpressed in other parts of his letters, when he says that he has\nsomething to tell that is \"so strange that I should never have mentioned\nit, even to my friends, had it not been corroborated... so unreal that I\nhesitated to speak of it, fearing that it was some freak of the\nimagination.\"\n\n\nVast and black. The thing that was poised, like a crow over the moon. Round and smooth. Cannon balls. Things that have fallen from the sky to\nthis earth. Our slippery brains. Things like cannon balls have fallen, in storms, upon this earth. Like\ncannon balls are things that, in storms, have fallen to this earth. Showers of blood. Showers of blood. Showers of blood. Whatever it may have been, something like red-brick dust, or a red\nsubstance in a dried state, fell at Piedmont, Italy, Oct. 27, 1814\n(_Electric Magazine_, 68-437). A red powder fell, in Switzerland, winter\nof 1867 (_Pop. Sci. Rev._, 10-112)--\n\nThat something, far from this earth, had bled--super-dragon that had\nrammed a comet--\n\nOr that there are oceans of blood somewhere in the sky--substance that\ndries, and falls in a powder--wafts for ages in powdered form--that\nthere is a vast area that will some day be known to aviators as the\nDesert of Blood. We attempt little of super-topography, at present, but\nOcean of Blood, or Desert of Blood--or both--Italy is nearest to it--or\nto them. I suspect that there were corpuscles in the substance that fell in\nSwitzerland, but all that could be published in 1867 was that in this\nsubstance there was a high proportion of \"variously shaped organic\nmatter.\"\n\nAt Giessen, Germany, in 1821, according to the _Report of the British\nAssociation_, 5-2, fell a rain of a peach-red color. In this rain were\nflakes of a hyacinthine tint. It is said that this substance was\norganic: we are told that it was pyrrhine. But distinctly enough, we are told of one red rain that it was of\ncorpuscular composition--red snow, rather. It fell, in the middle of the decade of the 1870s, near\nthe Crystal Palace, London (_Year Book of Facts_, 1876-89; _Nature_,\n13-414). As to the \"red snow\" of polar and mountainous regions, we have\nno opposition, because that \"snow\" has never been seen to fall from the\nsky: it is a growth of micro-organisms, or of a \"protococcus,\" that\nspreads over snow that is on the ground. This time nothing is said of\n\"sand from the Sahara.\" It is said of the red matter that fell in\nLondon, in the middle of the decade of the 1870s, that it was composed of corpuscles--\n\nOf course:\n\nThat they looked like \"vegetable cells.\"\n\nA note:\n\nThat nine days before had fallen the red substance--flesh--whatever it\nmay have been--of Bath County, Kentucky. I think that a super-egotist, vast, but not so vast as it had supposed,\nhad refused to move to one side for a comet. We summarize our general super-geographical expressions:\n\nGelatinous regions, sulphurous regions, frigid and tropical regions: a\nregion that has been Source of Life relatively to this earth: regions\nwherein there is density so great that things from them, entering this\nearth's thin atmosphere, explode.

We have had a datum of explosive hailstones. We now have support to the\nacceptance that they had been formed in a medium far denser than air of\nthis earth at sea-level. In the _Popular Science News_, 22-38, is an\naccount of ice that had been formed, under great pressure, in the\nlaboratory of the University of Virginia. When released and brought into\ncontact with ordinary air, this ice exploded. And again the flesh-like substance that fell in Kentucky: its flake-like\nformation. Here is a phenomenon that is familiar to us: it suggests\nflattening, under pressure. But the extraordinary inference is--pressure\nnot equal on all sides. In the _Annual Record of Science_, 1873-350, it\nis said that, in 1873, after a heavy thunderstorm in Louisiana, a\ntremendous number of fish scales were found, for a distance of forty\nmiles, along the banks of the Mississippi River: bushels of them picked\nup in single places: large scales that were said to be of the gar fish,\na fish that weighs from five to fifty pounds. It seems impossible to\naccept this identification: one thinks of a substance that had been\npressed into flakes or scales. And round hailstones with wide thin\nmargins of ice irregularly around them--still, such hailstones seem to\nme more like things that had been stationary: had been held in a field\nof thin ice. In the _Illustrated London News_, 34-546, are drawings of\nhailstones so margined, as if they had been held in a sheet of ice. Some day we shall have an expression which will be, to our advanced\nprimitiveness, a great joy:\n\nThat devils have visited this earth: foreign devils: human-like beings,\nwith pointed beards: good singers; one shoe ill-fitting--but with\nsulphurous exhalations, at any rate. I have been impressed with the\nfrequent occurrence of sulphurousness with things that come from the\nsky. A fall of jagged pieces of ice, Orkney, about 1818 (_Trans. Roy. Soc. Edin._, 9-187). They had a strong sulphurous odor. And the coke--or\nthe substance that looked like coke--that fell at Mortr\u00e9e, France, about 1887: with it fell a sulphurous substance. The enormous round things\nthat rose from the ocean, near the _Victoria_. Whether we still accept\nthat they were super-constructions that had come from a denser\natmosphere and, in danger of disruption, had plunged into the ocean for\nrelief, then rising and continuing on their way to Jupiter or Uranus--it\nwas reported that they spread a \"stench of sulphur.\" At any rate, this\ndatum of proximity is against the conventional explanation that these\nthings did not rise from the ocean, but rose far away above the horizon,\nwith illusion of nearness. And the things that were seen in the sky July, 1898: I have another\nnote. In _Nature_, 58-224, a correspondent writes that, upon late in the decade of the 1890s, at Sedberg, he had seen in the sky--a red object--or, in his own\nwording, something that looked like the red part of a rainbow, about 10\ndegrees long. But the sky was dark at the time. The sun had set. A heavy\nrain was falling. Throughout this book, the datum that we are most impressed with:\n\nSuccessive falls. Or that, if upon one small area, things fall from the sky, and then,\nlater, fall again upon the same small area, they are not products of a\nwhirlwind, which though sometimes axially stationary, discharges\ntangentially--\n\nSo the frogs that fell at Wigan. I have looked that matter up again. Later more frogs fell. As to our data of gelatinous substance said to have fallen to this earth\nwith meteorites, it is our expression that meteorites, tearing through\nthe shaky, protoplasmic seas of Genesistrine--against which we warn\naviators, or they may find themselves suffocating in a reservoir of\nlife, or stuck like currants in a blanc mange--that meteorites detach\ngelatinous, or protoplasmic, lumps that fall with them. Now the element of positiveness in our composition yearns for the\nappearance of completeness. Super-geographical lakes with fishes in\nthem. Meteorites that plunge through these lakes, on their way to this\nearth. The positiveness in our make-up must have expression in at least\none record of a meteorite that has brought down a lot of fishes with\nit--\n\n_Nature_, 3-512:\n\nThat, near the bank of a river, in Peru, Feb. 4, 1871, a meteorite\nfell. \"On the spot, it is reported, several dead fishes were found, of\ndifferent species.\" The attempt to correlate is--that the fishes \"are\nsupposed to have been lifted out of the river and dashed against the\nstones.\"\n\nWhether this be imaginable or not depends upon each one's own hypnoses. _Nature_, 4-169:\n\nThat the fishes had fallen among the fragments of the meteorite. _Popular Science Review_, 4-126:\n\nThat one day, Mr. Le Gould, an Australian scientist, was traveling in\nQueensland. He saw a tree that had been broken off close to the ground. Where the tree had been broken was a great bruise.",

The little carved stone that fell at Tarbes is my own choice as the most\nimpressive of our new correlates. It was coated with ice, remember. Suppose we should sift and sift and discard half the data in this\nbook--suppose only that one datum should survive. To call attention to\nthe stone of Tarbes would, in my opinion, be doing well enough, for\nwhatever the spirit of this book is trying to do.

The disk of quartz, said to have fallen from the sky, after a meteoric\nexplosion:\n\nSaid to have fallen at the plantation Bleijendal, Dutch Guiana: sent to\nthe Museum of Leyden by M. van Sypesteyn, adjutant to the Governor of\nDutch Guiana (_Notes and Queries_, 2-8-92). And the fragments that fall from super-geographic ice fields: flat\npieces of ice with icicles on them. I think that we did not emphasize\nenough that, if these structures were not icicles, but crystalline\nprotuberances, such crystalline formations indicate long suspension\nquite as notably as would icicles. In the _Popular Science News_, 24-34,\nit is said that in 1869, near Tiflis, fell large hailstones with long\nprotuberances. \"The most remarkable point in connection with the\nhailstones is the fact that, judging from our present knowledge, a very\nlong time must have been occupied in their formation.\" According to the\n_Geological Magazine_, 7-27, this fall occurred about 1869. The\nwriter in the _Geological Magazine_ says that of all theories that he\nhad ever heard of, not one could give him light as to this\noccurrence--\"these growing crystalline forms must have been suspended a\nlong time\"--\n\nAgain and again this phenomenon:\n\nFourteen days later, at about the same place, more of these hailstones\nfell. Rivers of blood that vein albuminous seas, or an egg-like composition in\nthe incubation of which this earth is a local center of\ndevelopment--that there are super-arteries of blood in Genesistrine:\nthat sunsets are consciousness of them: that they flush the skies with\nnorthern lights sometimes: super-embryonic reservoirs from which\nlife-forms emanate--\n\nOr that our whole solar system is a living thing: that showers of blood\nupon this earth are its internal hemorrhages--\n\nOr vast living things in the sky, as there are vast living things in the\noceans--\n\nOr some one especial thing: an especial time: an especial place. A thing\nthe size of the Brooklyn Bridge. It's alive in outer space--something\nthe size of Central Park kills it--\n\nIt drips. We think of the ice fields above this earth: which do not, themselves,\nfall to this earth, but from which water does fall--\n\n_Popular Science News_, 35-104:\n\nThat, according to Prof. Luigi Palazzo, head of the Italian\nMeteorological Bureau, upon about 1890, at Messignadi, Calabria,\nsomething the color of fresh blood fell from the sky. This substance was examined in the public-health laboratories of Rome. It was found to be blood. \"The most probable explanation of this terrifying phenomenon is that\nmigratory birds (quails or swallows) were caught and torn in a violent\nwind.\"\n\nSo the substance was identified as birds' blood--\n\nWhat matters it what the microscopists of Rome said--or had to say--and\nwhat matters it that we point out that there is no assertion that there\nwas a violent wind at the time--and that such a substance would be\nalmost infinitely dispersed in a violent wind--that no bird was said to\nhave fallen from the sky--or said to have been seen in the sky--that not\na feather of a bird is said to have been seen--\n\nThis one datum:\n\nThe fall of blood from the sky--\n\nBut later, in the same place, blood again fell from the sky. _Notes and Queries_, 7-8-508:\n\nA correspondent who had been to Devonshire writes for information as to\na story that he had heard there: of an occurrence of about thirty-five\nyears before the date of writing:\n\nOf snow upon the ground--of all South Devonshire waking up one morning\nto find such tracks in the snow as had never before been heard\nof--\"clawed footmarks\" of \"an unclassifiable form\"--alternating at huge\nbut regular intervals with what seemed to be the impression of the point\nof a stick--but the scattering of the prints--amazing expanse of\nterritory covered--obstacles, such as hedges, walls, houses, seemingly\nsurmounted--\n\nIntense excitement--that the track had been followed by huntsmen and\nhounds, until they had come to a forest--from which the hounds had\nretreated, baying and terrified, so that no one had dared to enter the\nforest.",

We have had the later accounts first very largely for an\nimpression of the correlating effect that time brings about, by\naddition, disregard and distortion. For instance, the \"dead calm in a\nsingle day.\" If I had found that the excitement did die out rather soon,\nI'd incline to accept that nothing extraordinary had occurred. I found that the excitement had continued for weeks. I recognize this as a well-adapted thing to say, to divert attention\nfrom a discorrelate. All phenomena are \"explained\" in the terms of the Dominant of their era. This is why we give up trying really to explain, and content ourselves\nwith expressing. Devils that might print marks in snow are correlates to\nthe third Dominant back from this era. So it was an adjustment by\nnineteenth-century correlates, or human tropisms, to say that the marks\nin the snow were clawed. Hoof-like marks are not only horsey but\ndevilish. It had to be said in the nineteenth century that those prints\nshowed claw-marks. We shall see that this was stated by Prof. Owen, one\nof the greatest biologists of his day--except that Darwin didn't think\nso. But I shall give reference to two representations of them that can\nbe seen in the New York Public Library. In neither representation is\nthere the faintest suggestion of a claw-mark. There never has been a\nProf. Owen who has explained: he has correlated. Another adaptation, in the later accounts, is that of leading this\ndiscorrelate to the Old Dominant into the familiar scenery of a fairy\nstory, and discredit it by assimilation to the conventionally\nfictitious--so the idea of the baying, terrified hounds, and forest like\nenchanted forests, which no one dared to enter. Hunting parties were\norganized, but the baying, terrified hounds do not appear in\ncontemporaneous accounts. The story of the kangaroo looks like adaptation to needs for an animal\nthat could spring far, because marks were found in the snow on roofs of\nhouses. But so astonishing is the extent of snow that was marked that\nafter a while another kangaroo was added. But the marks were in single lines. My own acceptance is that not less than a thousand one-legged kangaroos,\neach shod with a very small horseshoe, could have marked that snow of\nDevonshire. London _Times_, Feb 16, 1855:\n\n\"Considerable sensation has been caused in the towns of Topsham,\nLymphstone, Exmouth, Teignmouth, and Dawlish, in Devonshire, in\nconsequence of the discovery of a vast number of foot tracks of a most\nstrange and mysterious description.\"\n\nThe story is of an incredible multiplicity of marks discovered in the\nmorning of Feb. 8, 1855, in the snow, by the inhabitants of many towns\nand regions between towns. This great area must of course be disregarded\nby Prof. Owen and the other correlators. The tracks were in all kinds of\nunaccountable places: in gardens enclosed by high walls, and up on the\ntops of houses, as well as in the open fields. There was in Lymphstone\nscarcely one unmarked garden. We've had heroic disregards but I think\nthat here disregard was titanic. And, because they occurred in single\nlines, the marks are said to have been \"more like those of a biped than\nof a quadruped\"--as if a biped would place one foot precisely ahead of\nanother--unless it hopped--but then we have to think of a thousand, or\nof thousands. It is said that the marks were \"generally 8 inches in advance of each\nother.\"\n\n\"The impression of the foot closely resembles that of a donkey's shoe,\nand measured from an inch and a half, in some instances, to two and a\nhalf inches across.\"\n\nOr the impressions were cones in incomplete, or crescentic basins. The diameters equaled diameters of very young colts' hoofs: too small to\nbe compared with marks of donkey's hoofs. \"On Sunday last the Rev. Mr. Musgrave alluded to the subject in his\nsermon and suggested the possibility of the footprints being those of a\nkangaroo, but this could scarcely have been the case, as they were found\non both sides of the Este.

At present it remains a mystery, and many\nsuperstitious people in the above-named towns are actually afraid to go\noutside their doors after night.\"\n\nThe Este is a body of water two miles wide. London _Times_, about 1855:\n\n\"The interest in this matter has scarcely yet subsided, many inquiries\nstill being made into the origin of the footprints, which caused so much\nconsternation upon the morning of the 8th ult. In addition to the\ncircumstances mentioned in the _Times_ a little while ago, it may be\nstated that at Dawlish a number of persons sallied out, armed with guns\nand other weapons, for the purpose, if possible, of discovering and\ndestroying the animal which was supposed to have been so busy in\nmultiplying its footprints. As might have been expected, the party\nreturned as they went. Various speculations have been made as to the\ncause of the footprints. Some have asserted that they are those of a\nkangaroo, while others affirm that they are the impressions of claws of\nlarge birds driven ashore by stress of weather. On more than one\noccasion reports have been circulated that an animal from a menagerie\nhad been caught, but the matter at present is as much involved in\nmystery as ever it was.\"\n\nIn the _Illustrated London News_, the occurrence is given a great deal\nof space. In the issue of Feb. 24, 1855, a sketch is given of the\nprints. I call them cones in incomplete basins. Except that they're a little longish, they look like prints of hoofs of\nhorses--or, rather, of colts. But they're in a single line. It is said that the marks from which the sketch was made were 8 inches\napart, and that this spacing was regular and invariable \"in every\nparish.\" Also other towns besides those named in the _Times_ are\nmentioned. The writer, who had spent a winter in Canada, and was\nfamiliar with tracks in snow, says that he had never seen \"a more\nclearly defined track.\" Also he brings out the point that was so\npersistently disregarded by Prof. Owen and the other correlators--that\n\"no known animal walks in a line of single footsteps, not even man.\"\nWith these wider inclusions, this writer concludes with us that the\nmarks were not footprints. It may be that his following observation hits\nupon the crux of the whole occurrence:\n\nThat whatever it may have been that had made the marks, it had removed,\nrather than pressed, the snow. According to his observations the snow looked \"as if branded with a hot\niron.\"\n\n_Illustrated London News_, about 1855-214:\n\nProf. Owen, to whom a friend had sent drawings of the prints, writes\nthat there were claw-marks. He says that the \"track\" was made by \"a\"\nbadger. Six other witnesses sent letters to this number of the _News_. One\nmentioned, but not published, is a notion of a strayed swan. Always this\nhomogeneous-seeing--\"a\" badger--\"a\" swan--\"a\" track. I should have\nlisted the other towns as well as those mentioned in the _Times_. A letter from Mr. Musgrave is published. He, too, sends a sketch of the\nprints. It, too, shows a single line. There are four prints, of which\nthe third is a little out of line. There is no sign of a claw-mark. The prints look like prints of longish hoofs of a very young colt, but\nthey are not so definitely outlined as in the sketch of February 24th,\nas if drawn after disturbance by wind, or after thawing had set in. Measurements at places a mile and a half apart, gave the same\ninter-spacing--\"exactly eight inches and a half apart.\"\n\nWe now have a little study in the psychology and genesis of an attempted\ncorrelation. Mr. Musgrave says: \"I found a very apt opportunity to\nmention the name 'kangaroo' in allusion to the report then current.\" He\nsays that he had no faith in the kangaroo-story himself, but was glad\n\"that a kangaroo was in the wind,\" because it opposed \"a dangerous,\ndegrading, and false impression that it was the devil.\"\n\n\"Mine was a word in season and did good.\"\n\nWhether it's Jesuitical or not, and no matter what it is or isn't, that\nis our own acceptance: that, though we've often been carried away from\nthis attitude controversially, that is our acceptance as to every\ncorrelate of the past that has been considered in this book--relatively\nto the Dominant of its era. Another correspondent writes that, though the prints in all cases\nresembled hoof marks, there were indistinct traces of claws--that \"an\"\notter had made the marks. After that many other witnesses wrote to the\n_News_. The correspondence was so great that, in the issue of March\n10th, only a selection could be given. There's \"a\" jumping-rat solution\nand \"a\" hopping-toad inspiration, and then someone came out strong with\nan idea of \"a\" hare that had galloped with pairs of feet held close\ntogether, so as to make impressions in a single line.",

London _Times_, about 1840s:\n\n\"Among the high mountains of that elevated district where Glenorchy,\nGlenlyon and Glenochay are contiguous, there have been met with several\ntimes, during this and also the former winter, upon the snow, the tracks\nof an animal seemingly unknown at present in Scotland. The print, in\nevery respect, is an exact resemblance to that of a foal of considerable\nsize, with this small difference, perhaps, that the sole seems a little\nlonger, or not so round; but as no one has had the good fortune as yet\nto have obtained a glimpse of this creature, nothing more can be said of\nits shape or dimensions; only it has been remarked, from the depth to\nwhich the feet sank in the snow, that it must be a beast of considerable\nsize. It has been observed also that its walk is not like that of the\ngenerality of quadrupeds, but that it is more like the bounding or\nleaping of a horse when scared or pursued. It is not in one locality\nthat its tracks have been met with, but through a range of at least\ntwelve miles.\"\n\nIn the _Illustrated London News_, about 1855, a correspondent from\nHeidelberg writes, \"upon the authority of a Polish Doctor of Medicine,\"\nthat on the Piashowa-gora (Sand Hill) a small elevation on the border of\nGalicia, but in Russian Poland, such marks are to be seen in the snow\nevery year, and sometimes in the sand of this hill, and \"are attributed\nby the inhabitants to supernatural influences.\"",

Let's\ngive a dinner to my old friends of Mrs. Smithers's; they were nice old\npeople, and I should like to get them together again. I saw Dr. Pedagog\nin the city yesterday, and he inquired most affectionately, not to say\nanxiously, about the children.\"\n\n\"Why should he be anxious about the children?\" asked Mrs. Idiot,\nplacidly, as she sweetened her husband's coffee. \"Does he suspect them\nof lacking completeness or variety?\"\n\nThe Idiot tapped his forehead significantly. \"He didn't know whether they take after you or after me, but I relieved\nhis mind on that score,\" he said. \"I told him that they didn't take\nafter anybody that either of us ever knew. They have started in on a\nline of Idiocy that is entirely their own. He seemed very much pleased\nwhen I said that, and observed that he was glad to hear it.\"\n\nMrs. Idiot laughed. \"It was very nice of the Doctor to ask about them, but I am a little\nafraid he wants to take a hand in their bringing up,\" she said. \"No doubt of it,\" said the Idiot. \"Pedagog always was anxious to\nexperiment. Many a time I have suspected him of having designs even on\nme.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Pedagog told me last year that he had devised an entirely new\nsystem of home training,\" observed Mrs. Idiot, \"and they both regretted\nthat they had no children of their own to try it on.\"\n\n\"And of course you offered to lend Tommy to them?\" said the Idiot, with\na sly glance at his son, who was stowing away his oatmeal at a rate that\nbade fair to create a famine. \"Of course,\" said Mrs. Idiot. \"He's got to get raw material somewhere,\nand I thought Tommy would be just the thing.\"\n\n\"Well, I ain't a-goin',\" said Tommy, helping himself liberally and for\nthe third time to the oatmeal. \"My son,\" said the Idiot, with a mock show of sternness, \"if your mother\nchooses to lend you to any one it is not for you to say that you 'ain't\na-goin'. It may be that I shall interfere to the extent of demanding to\nknow what security for your safe return is offered, but otherwise\nneither you nor I shall intervene. What your mother says is law for you\nas well as for me. Please understand that, Thomas.\"\n\n\"All right, pa,\" said Tommy; and then he added in an undertone,\npresumably to the butter, \"But I ain't a-goin', just the same.\"\n\n\"I'll go,\" said Mollie, who rather liked the idea of being lent to\nsomebody, since it involved a visit to some strange and therefore\nfascinating spot away from home. \"Lend me to somebody, will you, mamma?\"\n\n\"Yes, ma, lend Mollie to 'em,\" said Tommy, with, a certain dry\nenthusiasm, \"and then maybe you can borrow a boy from somebody else for\nme to play with. I don't see why you don't swap her off for a boy,\nanyhow. I like her well enough, but what you ever wanted to buy her for\nin the beginning I don't know. Girls isn't any good.\"\n\n\"Thomas,\" said the Idiot, \"you talk too much, and, what is more, you say\nvain things which some day you will regret. When you get older you will\nrecall this dictum of yours, that 'girls isn't any good,' with a blush\nof shame, and remember that your mother was once a girl.\"\n\n\"Well, she's outgrown it,\" said Tommy; and then reverting to his\nfather's choice of words, he added, \"What is dictums, anyhow?\"\n\n\"Pooh!\" cried the little girl. \"Smarty don't know what dictums is!\"\n\n\"Suppose you two young persons subside for a few minutes!\" interrupted\nthe Idiot. \"I wish to talk to your mother, and I haven't got all day. You'll be wanting some bread and butter to-morrow, and I must go to town\nand earn it.\"\n\n\"All right, pa,\" said Tommy. \"I ain't got anything to say that I can't\nsay to myself. I'd rather talk to myself, anyhow. You can be as sassy--\"\n\n\"Thomas!\" said the Idiot, severely. \"All right, pa,\" said Tommy; and with a side remark to the cream-jug,\nthat he still thought Mollie ought to be swapped off for something, it\ndidn't matter what as long as it wasn't another girl, the boy lapsed\ninto a deep though merely temporary silence. \"You said you'd like to give a dinner to Mr. and Mrs. Pedagog and the\nothers,\" said Mrs. Idiot. \"I quite approve.\"\n\n\"I think it would be nice,\" returned the Idiot. \"It has been more than\nsix years since we were all together.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't prefer having them at breakfast, would you?\" asked Mrs. Idiot, with a smile. \"I remember hearing you say once that breakfast was\nyour best time.\"\n\n\"How long is six years, pa?\" asked Tommy. \"Really, Thomas,\" replied the Idiot, severely, \"you are the most absurd\ncreature. How long is six years!\"\n\n\"I meant in inches,\" said Tommy, unabashed. \"You always told me to ask\nyou when I wanted to know things. Of course, if you don't know--\"\n\n\"It's more'n a mile, I guess,\" observed Mollie, with some superiority of\nmanner. \"Ain't it, pa?\"\n\nThe Idiot glanced at his wife in despair. \"I don't think, my dear, that I am as strong at breakfast as I used to\nbe,\" said he. \"There was a time when I could hold my own, but things\nseem to have changed. Make it dinner; and, Tommy, when you have deep\nproblems to solve, like how long is six years in inches, try to work\nthem out for yourself.

I thought you\nsaid you knew everything.\"\n\n\n\nIn accordance with the Idiot's suggestion the invitations were sent out. It was a most agreeable proposition as far as his wife was concerned,\nfor the Idiot's old associates, his fellow-boarders at Mrs. Smithers-Pedagog's \"High-Class Home for Single Gentlemen,\" had proved\nto be the stanchest of his friends. They had, as time passed on, gone\ntheir several ways. The Poet had made himself so famous that even his\nbad things got into print; the Bibliomaniac, by an unexpected stroke of\nfortune, had come into possession of his own again, and now possessed a\nlibrary of first editions that auctioneers looked upon with envious\neyes, and which aroused the hatred of many another collector. The Doctor\nhad prospered equally, and was now one of the most successful operators\nfor appendicitis; in fact, could now afford to refuse all other practice\nthan that involved in that delicate and popular line of work. The genial\ngentleman who occasionally imbibed had not wholly reformed, but, as the\nIdiot put it, had developed into one who occasionally did _not_ imbibe. Mr. Brief had become an assistant district attorney, and was prominently\nmentioned for a judgeship, and Mr. and Mrs. Pedagog lived placidly along\ntogether, never for an instant regretting the inspiration which led them\nto economize by making two into one. In short, time and fortune had\ndealt kindly with all, even with Mary, the housemaid, who was now\ngeneral manager of the nursery in the Idiot's household. The home life of \"Mr. and Mrs. Idiot\" had been all that either of the\nyoung people could have wished for, and prosperity had waited upon them\nin all things. The Idiot had become a partner in the business of his\nfather-in-law, and even in bad times had managed to save something,\nuntil now, with two children, aged five and six, he found himself the\npossessor of his own home in a suburban city. It had been finished only\na month when the proposed dinner was first mentioned, and the natural\npride of its master and mistress was delightful to look upon. \"Why, do you know, my dear,\" said the Idiot one evening, on his return\nfrom town, \"they are talking of asking me to resign from the club\nbecause they say I am offensive about this place, and Watson says my\nconversation has become a bore to everybody because the burden of my\nsong yesterday was pots and pans and kettles and things like that?\"\n\n\"I suppose clubmen are not interested in pots and pans and kettles and\nthings,\" Mrs. Idiot observed. \"Some people aren't, you know.\"\n\n\"Not interested?\" echoed the Idiot. \"What kind of people can they be not\nto be interested in pots and pans and kettles and things? I guess it's\nbecause of their dense ignorance.\"\n\n\n\n\"They never had the fun of buying them, perhaps,\" suggested Mrs. Idiot. \"Possibly,\" assented the Idiot. \"And I'll tell you one thing, Pollie,\ndear,\" he added, \"if they had had that fun just once, instead of\nsquandering their savings on clothes and the theatre, and on horses,\nyou'd find every blessed one of those chaps thronging the hardware shops\nall day and spending their money there. Why, do you know I even enjoyed\ngetting the clothes-pins, and what is more, it was instructive. I never\nknew before what countless varieties of clothes-pins there were. There's\nthe plain kind of commerce that look like a pair of legs with a polo-cap\non. I was brought up on those, and I used to steal them when I was a\nsmall boy, to act as understudies for Noah and Shem and Ham and Japheth\nin my Noah's ark. Then there's the patent kind with a spring to it that\nis guaranteed to hang onto a garment in a gale if it has to let go of\nthe rope.

The evidence was overwhelming, and Mrs. Idiot, with an appreciative\nebullition of mirth, acknowledged herself defeated, and so charmingly\nwithal, that the next day when her husband returned home he brought her\ntwo tickets for the opera of Siegfried as a reward for her graceful\nsubmission. \"I could have bought ten dozen muffin-rings for the same money,\" said\nhe, as he gave them to her, \"but people who know when to give in, and do\ngive in as amiably as you do, my dear, deserve to be rewarded; and, on\nthe whole, when you use these tickets, if you'll ask me, I think I'll\nescort you to Siegfried myself.\"",

    "text": "II\n\nA LITTLE DINNER TO SOME OLD FRIENDS\n\n\n\nTen days later all was excitement at the Idiot's new home. Tommy and\nMollie were in a state bordering upon frenzy, and gave the cook a great\ndeal of trouble, requesting a taste of this, that, and the other thing,\nwhich she was preparing for the dinner to Mr. and Mrs. Pedagog, the\nBibliomaniac, and the others. Inwardly, too, they were somewhat\nwrathful, for they could not understand why they were not permitted to\ndine with their parents as usual. \"I guess maybe it's your manners that keeps you away, Tommy,\" said\nMollie. \"Hoh!\" said Tommy. \"It can't be that, because pa says I ain't got any. It's because you're too young to be introdoosed into society, and I've\ngot to stay up-stairs and look after you. If you weren't a girl!\"\n\nHere Tommy clenched his fists and looked unutterable things. Mollie\nshuddered and was glad she was a girl as she imagined the awful things\nTommy would do to her had she been a boy. \"Neither of 'em's it, Tommy,\" she said, in a conciliatory manner. \"It's\nbecause they ain't got enough dining-room chairs, that's why. I know,\nbecause I counted 'em, and there's only eight, and there's nine people\ncomin'.\"\n\n\"I guess maybe that's it,\" said Tommy, pacified somewhat. \"And anyhow, I\ndon't care. I saw that piece of paper ma gave Jennie, and she wrote down\nall the things they're goin' to have, and it's goin' to be two hours\nbetween the soup and the ice-cream. I couldn't ever wait that long for\nthe ice-cream. I don't see why they don't begin with ice-cream.\"\n\n\"I guess maybe we're better off as it is,\" said Mollie. \"Popper and\nmommer ain't likely to forget us, and, besides, we can talk.\"\n\nAnd with this comforting reflection the little ones retired to their\nnursery contented in mind and spirit--and they didn't suffer a bit. Their \"popper and mommer\" didn't forget them. The ice-cream was\nexcellent, and they had their share of it almost before the guests began\nwith their oysters. At seven o'clock Mr. and Mrs. Pedagog had arrived, and at seven-ten all\nthe invited guests were present. \"If it hadn't been for my wife,\" Mr. Pedagog whispered in his host's\near, \"I should have been late, too.\"\n\n\"Don't apologize, old man,\" replied the Idiot, gripping the\nSchoolmaster's hand warmly. \"I sometimes go to dinners on time myself.\"\n\nIn a few moments dinner was announced, and shortly after all were\nseated, and in memory of old times the guests naturally waited for the\nIdiot to begin. \"Do you know,\" he said, as he squeezed the juice from a luscious lemon\nover an unprotesting oyster, at the same time glancing affectionately\nover the company, \"I haven't felt so much at home for years as I do\nnow.\"\n\n\"Not very complimentary to your wife,\" said Mr. Brief. \"Oh, I know what he means,\" observed Mrs. Idiot. \"And I have so many other opportunities to compliment her,\" said the\nIdiot. \"But really, Mrs. Pedagog,\" he added, addressing the good lady who sat\nat his right, \"I feel absolutely contented to-night. All the good things\nof the past and of the present seem to be concentrated about this\nboard--except the three up-stairs, who can't very well be here.\"\n\n\"Three?\" asked Mr. Pedagog. \"I thought there were only two--\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said the Idiot. \"Tommy and Mollie, but there is Mary, your\nold housemaid. We can't very well ask them to dine with us, you know.\"\n\n\"I don't see why Tommy and Mollie can't be invited,\" said Mr. Pedagog,\nmuch to the Idiot's surprise, it seemed so like a violation of his\nsystem, as it might be presumed to be. \"You believe in having children at table, then, Mr. Pedagog?\" asked Mrs. Idiot. \"Most certainly,\" said the Schoolmaster. Mrs. Pedagog glanced smilingly\nat Mrs. Idiot, as much as to say, \"Oh, these men!\"\n\n\"I certainly do approve of having children at table on all occasions,\"\nhe continued. \"How else are they to learn how to conduct themselves? The\ndiscipline of the nursery is apt to be lax, and it is my belief that\nmany of the bad table manners of the present-day child are due to the\nsense of freedom which eating dinner in the nursery naturally\ninculcates.\"\n\n\"There is something in what you say,\" said the Idiot. \"Tommy, for\ninstance, never learned to throw a French pancake across the table at\nhis sister by watching his mother and myself here in the dining-room,\nyet in the freedom of the nursery I have known it done.\"\n\n\"Precisely,\" said Mr. Pedagog. \"That very little incident illustrates my\npoint exactly. And I have no doubt that in the nursery the offence\nseemed less heinous than it would had it occurred in the dining-room,\nand hence did not meet with the full measure of punishment that it\ndeserved.\"\n\n\"I have forgotten exactly what was done on that occasion,\" said the\nIdiot, calmly. \"It is my impression that I compelled Thomas to eat the\npancake.\"\n\n\"I am sure I never heard of the incident before,\" said Mrs. Idiot, her\ncheeks growing very red. \"He didn't really, did he, dear?\"\n\n\"By jove!\" cried the Idiot, snapping his forefinger against his thumb,\n\"what a traitor I am, to be sure. I promised Thomas never to tell, and\nhere I've given the poor little chap away; but the boy was excusable, I\nassure you all--that is, he was excusable in a sense. Mollie had\npreviously hit him in the eye with a salted almond, and--\"\n\n\"It is quite evident,\" put in Mrs. Pedagog, her womanly sympathy leading\nher to rush to the aid of Mrs. Idiot, who seemed somewhat mortified over\nthe Idiot's confidences, \"that you were not at home, my dear. I have\nmyself observed that extraordinary episodes of this nature generally\nhappen when it is the father who is left in charge of the children.\"\n\n\"Quite right, Mrs.",

As long as\nthe mother is about discipline is maintained, but once leave the father\nin charge and riot is the order of the day.\"\n\n\"That's exactly what I was going to say,\" said the Idiot. \"Many a time\nwhen Mrs. Idiot has gone out shopping, as she did on the day in\nquestion, and I have remained at home for a rest, I have wished\nbefore evening came that I had gone shopping and let my wife have the\nrest. As a matter of fact, the bringing up of children should be left to\nthe mother--\"\n\n\"Oh, but the father should have something to do with it,\" interrupted\nMrs. Idiot. \"It is too great a responsibility to place on a woman's\nshoulders.\"\n\n\"You didn't let me finish, my dear,\" said the Idiot, amiably. \"I was\ngoing to say that the mother should bring the children up, and the\nfather should take 'em down when they get up too high.\"\n\n\"My views to a dot,\" said Mr. Pedagog, with more enthusiasm than he had\never yet shown over the Idiot's dicta. \"Just as in ordinary colonial\ngovernment, the home authorities should govern, and when necessary a\nstronger power should intervene.\"\n\n\"Ideal--is it not?\" laughed Mrs. Idiot, addressing Mrs. Pedagog. \"The\nmother, Spain. The children, Cuba. Papa, the great and glorious United\nStates!\"\n\n\"Ahem! Well,\" said Mr. Pedagog, \"I didn't mean that exactly, you know--\"\n\n\"But it's what you said, John,\" said Mrs. Pedagog, somewhat severely. \"Well, I don't see why there can't be a division of responsibility,\"\nsaid the Poet, who had never married, and who knew children only as a\ntheory. \"Let the mothers look after them in the daytime, and the fathers\nat night.\"\n\nThis sally was greeted with an outburst of applause, it was so\npractical. \"Excuse me!\" said the Idiot. \"I'm not selfish, but I don't want to have\ncharge of the children at night. Why, when Tommy was cutting his teeth I\nsuffered agonies when night came on. I was down-town all day, and so\nwasn't very much bothered then, but at night it was something awful. Not\nonly Tommy's tooth, but the fear that his mother would tread on a tack.\"\n\n\"That was unselfish,\" said Mr. Pedagog, dryly. \"You weren't afraid of\ntreading on one yourself.\"\n\n\"How could I?\" said the Idiot. \"I had all I could do trying to keep my\nwife from knowing that I was disturbed. It is bad enough to be worried\nover a crying babe, without being bothered by an irritated husband, so I\nsimply lay there pretending to be asleep and snoring away for dear\nlife.\"\n\n\"You are the most considerate man I ever heard of,\" said Mrs. Pedagog,\nsmiling broadly. \"You don't mean to say,\" said the Poet, with a frown, \"that you made\nyour wife get up and take all the trouble and bother--\"\n\n\"I'd only have been in the way,\" said the Idiot, meekly. \"So he kept quiet and pretended to snore like the good old Idiot that he\nis,\" put in the Doctor. \"And he did the right thing, too,\" he added. \"If\nall fathers would obliterate themselves on occasions of that sort, and\nlet the mothers rule, the Tommys and Dickies and Harrys would go to\nsleep a great deal more quickly.\"\n\n\"We are rambling,\" said Mr. Pedagog. \"The question of a father's duty\ntowards a teething son has nothing to do with the question of a child's\nright to dine with his parents.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know,\" said the Idiot. \"If we are to consider this matter\nscientifically we must start right. Teething is a natural first step,\nfor if a child hath no teeth, wherewithal shall he eat dinners with his\nparents or without them?\"\n\n\"That is all very well,\" retorted Mr. Pedagog, \"but to discuss\nfire-engines intelligently it is not necessary to go back to the times\nof Elisha to begin it.\"\n\nMr. Whitechoker--now the Rev.

There is no man in the world who\nmore thoroughly appreciates a biblical joke than the prosperous\nclergyman. \"Well,\" said the Idiot, reflectively, \"I quite agree with your\nproposition that children should dine in the dining-room with their\nparents and not up-stairs in the nursery, with a lot of tin soldiers and\ngolliwogs. The manners of parents are no better than those of tin\nsoldiers and golliwogs, but their conversation is apt to prove more\ninstructive; and as for the stern father who says his children must dine\nin the kitchen until they learn better manners, I never had much\nconfidence in him or in his manners, either.\"\n\n\"I don't see,\" said the genial old gentleman who occasionally imbibed,\n\"how you can discipline children in the nursery.",

Their wickedness grows out of their wonderful stores of\nunexpended and unexpendable energy. Take my son Thomas on last Saturday\nafternoon, for instance. It was a rainy Saturday, and Tommy, instead of\nbeing out-of-doors all morning and afternoon getting rid of his\nsuperfluous vitality, had been cooped up in the house all day doing\nnothing. Shortly before dinner we had a difference of opinion which\nlasted for more time than I like to think about. I was tired and\nirritable. Tommy wasn't tired, but he _was_ irritable, and, from his\npoint of view, was as right as I was. He had the best of me to the\nextent that I was tired and he wasn't. I had the best of him to the\nextent that I had authority and he hadn't--\"\n\n\"And who came out ahead?\" asked Mr. Pedagog. \"I did,\" said the Idiot, \"because I was bigger than he was; but what I\nwas going to say was this: Mr. Brief would have sent him to bed,\nthereby adding to the boy's stock of energy, already too great for his\nlittle mind to control.\"\n\n\"And what did you do?\" asked Mr. Brief. \"Nothin',\" said a small but unmistakably masculine voice from behind the\nportieres. \"Thomas!\" said the Idiot, severely, as all turned to see who had spoken. A little figure clad in white, ably supported by a still smaller figure,\nalso clad in white, but with an additional ruffle about the neck, both\nof them barefooted, appeared in the doorway. \"Why, Mollie!\" said Mrs. Idiot. \"We comed down to thee how you wath gettin' along,\" said the little\ngirl. \"Yes, we did,\" said the boy. \"But he didn't do a thing to me that day,\"\nhe added, climbing on his father's knee and snuggling down against his\nvest-pocket with a sweet little sigh of satisfaction. \"Did you, pa?\"\n\n\"Yes, Thomas,\" said the Idiot. \"Don't you remember that I ignored you\nutterly?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yes, I do,\" said Tommy. \"But I'd rather be spanked than not noticed at\nall.\"\n\n\"I am afraid,\" said Mr. Pedagog a few hours later, as he and Mrs. Pedagog were returning home, \"I am very much afraid that the Idiot's\nchildren are being spoiled.\"\n\n\"I hope they are!\" returned the good lady, \"for really, John, I never\nknew a boy or a girl to grow into man or womanhood and amount to\nanything who hadn't been spoiled in childhood. Spoiling is another name\nfor the attitude of parents who make comrades of their children and who\ndo not set themselves up as tyrants--\"\n\n\"But the veneration of a child for his father and mother--\" Mr. Pedagog\nbegan. \"Should not degenerate into the awe which one feels for an unrelenting\ndespot!\" interrupted Mrs. Pedagog. The old gentleman discreetly retired from the field. As for Mrs. and Mr. Idiot, they retired that night satisfied with the\nevening's diversion, and just before he turned out the light the Idiot\nwalked into the nursery to say good-night to the children. \"You're a good old pop!\" said Tommy, with an affectionate hug. \"_The\nbest I ever had!_\"\n\nAs for Mollie, she was sleeping soundly, with a smile on her placid\nlittle face which showed that, \"spoiled\" as she was, she was happy; and\nwhat should the Idiot or any one else seek to bring into a child's life\nbut happiness?",

    "text": "III\n\nIN THE LIBRARY\n\nThe Bibliomaniac had come off into the country to spend Sunday with the\nIdiot, and, as fortune would have it, Mr. and Mrs. Pedagog also appeared\non the scene. After the mid-day dinner the little party withdrew to the\nlibrary, where the Bibliomaniac began to discourse somewhat learnedly\nupon his hobby. \"I am glad to see, my dear Idiot,\" he observed, as he glanced about the\nroom at the well-filled shelves, \"that as you grow older you are\ncultivating a love of good literature.\"\n\n\"I heartily echo the sentiment,\" said Mr. Pedagog, as he noted the\ntitles of some of the volumes. \"I may add that I am pleasurably\nsurprised at some of your selections. I never knew, for instance, that\nyou cared for Dryden, and yet I see here on the top shelf a voluminous\nedition of that poet.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the Idiot. \"I have found Dryden very useful indeed. Particularly in that binding and in so many volumes. The color goes very\nwell with the hangings, and the space the books occupy, eked out by a\ndozen others of the same color, gives to that top shelf all the esthetic\neffect of an attractive and tasteful frieze. Then, too, it is always\nwell,\" he added, with a sly wink at Mrs. Idiot, \"to have a lot of books\nfor a top shelf that is difficult to reach that nothing under the canopy\ncould induce you to read. It is not healthful to be stretching upward,\nand with Dryden upon the top shelf my wife and I are never tempted to\nundermine our constitutions by taking him down.\"\n\nThe Bibliomaniac laughed. \"Your view is at least characteristic,\" said he, \"and to tell you the\nabsolute truth, I do not know that your judgment of the literary value\nof Dryden is at variance with my own. Somebody called him the Greatest\nPoet of a Little Age. Perhaps if the age had been bigger he'd not have\nshone so brilliantly.\"\n\n\"Lowell,\" observed Mr. Pedagog, \"was responsible for that remark, if I\nremember rightly, and I have no doubt it is a just one, and yet I do not\nhold it up against Dryden. Man does not make the age. The age makes the\nman. Had there been any inspiring influences at work to give him a\nmotive, an incentive, Dryden might have been a greater poet. To excel\nhis fellows was all that could rightly be expected of him, and that he\ndid.\"\n\n\"Assuredly,\" said the Idiot. \"That has always been my view, and to-day\nwe benefit by it. If he had gone directly to oblivion, Mrs. Idiot and I\nshould have been utterly at a loss to know what to put on that top\nshelf.\"\n\nThe Idiot offered his visitors a cigar. \"Thank you,\" said the Bibliomaniac, taking his and sniffing at it with\nall the airs and graces of a connoisseur. \"I don't know but that I will join you,\" said Mr. Pedagog. \"I did not\nsmoke until I was fifty, and I suppose I ought not to have taken it up\nthen, but I did, and I have taken a great deal of comfort out of it. My\nallowance is fifty-two cigars a year, one for each Sunday afternoon,\" he\nadded, with a kindly smile. \"Well, you want to look out you don't get smoker's heart,\" said the\nIdiot. \"When a man plunges into a bad habit as rashly as that, he wants\nto pull up before it is too late.\"\n\n\"I have felt no ill effects since the first one,\" rejoined Mr. Pedagog. \"But you, my dear Idiot, how about your allowance? Is it still as great\nas ever? As I remember you in the old days you were something of a\ncigarette fiend.\"\n\n\n\n\"I smoke just as much, but with this difference: I do not smoke for\npleasure any more, Mr. Pedagog,\" the Idiot replied. \"As a householder I\nsmoke from a sense of duty. It keeps moths out of the house, and insects\nfrom the plants.\"\n\n[Illustration: \"THE BIBLIOMANIAC WAS INVESTIGATING THE CONTENTS OF THE\nLOWER SHELVES\"]\n\nThe Bibliomaniac meanwhile had been investigating the contents of the\nlower shelves. \"You've got a few rare things here, I see,\" he observed, taking up a\nvolume of short sketches illustrated by Leech, in color. \"This small\ntome is worth its weight in gold. Where did you pick it up?\"\n\n\"Auction,\" said the Idiot. \"I didn't buy it by weight, either. I bought\nit by mistake. The colored pictures fascinated me, and when it was\nput up I bawled out 'fifteen.' Another fellow said 'sixteen.' I wasn't\ngoing to split nickels so I bid 'twenty.' So we kept at it until it was\nrun up to 'thirty-six.' Then I thought I'd break the other fellow's\nheart by bidding fifty, and it was knocked down to me.\"\n\n\"That's a stiff price, but on the whole it's worth it,\" said the\nBibliomaniac, stroking the back of the book caressingly. \"But,\" said Mr. Pedagog, \"if you bid on it consciously where did the\nmistake come in?\"\n\nThe Idiot sighed. \"I meant cents,\" he said, \"but the other chap and the\nauctioneer meant dollars. I went up and planked down a half-dollar and\nwas immediately made aware of my error.\"\n\n\"But you could have explained,\" said Mr. Pedagog. \"Oh, yes,\" said the Idiot, \"I _could_, but after all I preferred to pay\nthe extra $49.50 rather than make a public confession of such infernal\ninnocence before some sixty or seventy _habitues_ of a book-auction\nroom.\"\n\n\"And you were perfectly right!\" said the Bibliomaniac. \"You never would\nhave dared set your foot in that place again if you had explained. They\nwould have made life a burden to you. Furthermore, you have not paid too\ndearly for the experience.",

And now that I find you two gentlemen interested in a phase of\nbook-collecting with which I have had little sympathy myself, possibly I\nmay, without being offensive, ask a question. Do you, for instance,\nMr. Idiot, collect books because you wish to have something nobody else\nhas got, or do you buy your books to read?\"\n\n\"That is a deep question,\" said the Idiot, \"and I do not know that I can\nanswer it off-hand. I have already confessed that I bought Dryden for\nhis decorative quality. I purchased my Thackeray to read. I bought my\nPepys Diary because I find it better reading than a Sunday newspaper,\nquite as gossipy, and with weather reports that are fully as reliable. But that particular Leech I bought because of my youthful love for\ncolored pictures.\"\n\n\"But you admit that it is valuable because of its rarity, and that\ncompared to fifty dollars' worth of books that are not rare it is not to\nbe compared with them from a literary point of view?\" said Mr. Pedagog. \"I presume,\" said the Idiot, \"that the fifty dollars I expended on that\nbook would have provided me with a complete Shakespeare in one volume;\nall of Byron in green cloth and gold top; all of Dickens, Thackeray,\nBulwer, and Austen in six volumes, with a margin of forty-five dollars\nleft with which for nine years I could have paid for a subscription to\nthe Mercantile Library, containing all the good reading of the present\nday and all the standard works of the past. But I rather like to have\nthe books, and to feel that they are my own, even if it is only for the\npleasure of lending them.\"\n\n\"Still, if a man collects books merely for their contents--\" persisted\nMr. Pedagog. \"He is a wild, extravagant person,\" said the Idiot. \"He might save\nhimself hundreds of dollars, not to say thousands. The library on that\nplan need not occupy an honored place among the rooms of the house. A\nmere pigeon-hole with a subscriber's card to a circulating library filed\naway in it will do as well, or if the city or town in which he lives\nmaintains a public library he may spare himself even that expense.\"\n\n\"Good for you!\" exclaimed the Bibliomaniac. \"That's the best answer to\nthe critics of book-collectors I have heard yet.\"\n\n\"I agree with you,\" said Mr. Pedagog. \"It is a very comprehensive reply. As for you, my dear Bibliomaniac, why do you collect books?\"\n\n\"Because I love 'em as books,\" replied the Bibliomaniac. \"Because of\ntheir associations, and because when I get a treasure I have the bliss\nof knowing I have something that others haven't.\"\n\n\"Then it is selfishness?\" asked Mr. Pedagog. \"Just as everything else is,\" returned the Bibliomaniac. \"You, sir, if I\nmay be personal without wishing to be offensive, are wedded to Mrs. Pedagog. You take pleasure in knowing that she belongs to you and not to\nany one else. The Idiot here is proud of his children, and is glad they\nare his children and nobody else's. _I_ am wedded to my rare books, and\nit rejoices my soul to pick up a volume that is unique, and to know that\nit belongs to me and to no one else. If that is selfishness, then all\npossession is selfish.\"\n\n\"That's about it,\" said the Idiot. \"You collect books just as Mormons\nand Solomon used to collect wives. You are called a Bibliomaniac. I\nsuppose Brigham Young and Solomon would have been known as\nGamyomaniacs--though I don't suppose that age in women as in books is a\nrequisite of value to marrying men--and they are both of them supposed\nto be rather canny persons.\"\n\nMr. Pedagog puffed away in silence. It was evident that the _argumentum\nad hominem_ did not please him. \"Well,\" he said, after awhile, \"possibly you are right. If a man wants a\nlibrary to be a small British Museum--\"\n\n\"He will take better care of his rarities than the Idiot does,\" said the\nBibliomaniac, putting the rare Leech back into its place. \"If that were\nmine I'd put it out of the reach of my children.\"\n\n\"I didn't know you had any,\" said the Idiot, eagerly.",

But this\nbook, which is worth ten larger paper editions of Dryden, you keep\nbelow, where the children can easily reach it. It's a wonder to me\nyou've been able to keep it in its present superb condition.\"\n\n\"The mind of a child,\" said Mr. Pedagog, sententiously, \"is above\nvalues, above all conceits. It is the mind of sincerity, and a rare book\nhas no greater attraction to the boy or girl than one not so favored.\"\n\n\"That is not my reason,\" said the Idiot. \"I know children pretty well,\nand I have observed that they are ambitious, and in a sense rebellious. They want to do what they cannot do. That is why, when mothers place jam\non the top shelf of the pantry, the children always climb up to get it. If they would leave it on the dining-room table, within easy reach, the\nchildren would soon cease to regard it as a thing to be sought for. Make\njam a required article of diet and the little ones will soon cease to\nwant it. So with that book. If I should put that out of Tommy's reach,\nTommy would lie awake nights to plan his campaign to get it. Leaving it\nwhere it is he doesn't think about it, doesn't want it, is not forbidden\nto have it, and so it escapes his notice.\"\n\n\"You have the right idea, the human idea,\" said Mr. Pedagog, and even\nthe Bibliomaniac was inclined to agree. But just then Tommy happened in,\nwith Mollie close after. The boy walked straight to the bookcase, and\nMollie gathered up the large shears from the Idiot's table, and together\nthey approached their father. \"Pa,\" said Mollie, holding up the scissors, \"can I borrow these?\"\n\n\"What for?\" asked the Idiot. \"We want to cut the pictures out o' this,\" said Tommy, holding up the\nfifty-dollar Leech. After all, it is difficult to lay down a cast-iron rule as to how a\nprivate library should be constructed or arranged, particularly when\none's loyalty is divided between one's children and one's merely bookish\ntreasures.",

    "text": "IV\n\nAS TO A SMALL DINNER\n\n\n\nIt was sad but true. Mr. and Mrs. Idiot had invited Mr. Whitechoker and\nMr. and Mrs. Pedagog and the Poet to dinner, and for some reason or\nanother the cook had taken wings unto herself and flown, and the guests\nwere expected within two hours. \"I see now,\" said the Idiot, \"why they call it taking French leave. Nobody who doesn't understand French understands it. If it wasn't\nFrench, or if somebody would translate it for us, we might be able to\ncomprehend it; as it is, it is one of the mysteries, and, as usual, we\nmust make the best of it. Life, after all, my dear, consists largely of\nmaking the best of things.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm sure I don't know what to do,\" said Mrs. Idiot, despairfully,\n\"unless you telegraph them all not to come, and tell them why.\"\n\n\"It is too late to do that,\" said the Idiot, looking at his watch. \"They've probably all left home by this time. Poets and clergymen and\nold people like Mr. and Mrs. Pedagog always do start an hour too early,\nfor fear of missing their train.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't care so much about the Poet,\" said Mrs. Idiot; \"he doesn't\nknow enough about housekeeping, anyhow, to make it matter. But Mr. Whitechoker and Mr. and Mrs. Pedagog--I simply can't ask them to camp\nout, as it were. The very fact that Mrs. Pedagog would become\nsympathetic immediately she learned what had happened would in itself be\nunbearable.\"\n\n\"I thought women liked sympathy?\" said the Idiot, with a proper\nmanifestation of surprise. \"So they do; but you might just as well talk about claret as meaning one\nthing as of sympathy being all of the same brand,\" Mrs. Idiot answered. \"Certain kinds of claret are insufferable--sour and heady. I suppose\nthere are sixty different kinds.\"\n\n\"Sixty-two,\" said the Idiot, blandly. \"The sixty you mean and two more\nwhose names I have forgotten.\"\n\n\"I wish you would be serious for a moment,\" Mrs. Idiot retorted, with as\nnear an approach to irritation as was possible to one of her amiable\ndisposition. \"And it's just the same way with sympathy,\" she continued;\n\"Mrs. Pedagog will lay this whole trouble to my inexperience. Probably\nshe never had a servant take French leave in her life on the eve of a\ndinner-party.\"\n\n\"I'll bet she didn't,\" said the Idiot. \"And for why? Because she never\ngave a dinner-party in all her life. The habits of early life cling unto\nold age, and even as in her early days as a boarding-house keeper she\nnever gave anything, so now she doubtless considers giving a dinner as a\nreckless waste of opportunity. And she is quite right. Does a lawyer\ninvite his friends to join him in an opinion? Never. Does Mr. Tiffany\nrequest Mr. and Mrs. Idiot to accept a diamond tiara given in their\nhonor? Not. Does a true poet, with three names on his autograph, give a\npoem to anybody when he can sell it? Not if he knows it. Why, then,\nexpect a landlady, by birth and previous training, to _give_ a dinner?\"\n\n\"I notice,\" said Mrs. Idiot, severely, \"that you are always willing to\ngive your views!\"\n\n[Illustration: \"'TWO BIG BOXES OF POTATOES, A CAN OF FRENCH PEASE, AND A\nBOTTLE OF SARSAPARILLA'\"]\n\n\"Precisely, my dear, and that proves my point,\" replied the Idiot,\namiably. \"I am not a professional viewer, and I am not a photographer by\ntrade. Therefore, why should I not _give_ my views? But really,\" he\nadded, \"I wouldn't bother; it'll all come out right. I don't know just\nhow, but I am confident we shall have the most glorious dinner of our\nlives. When I was down cellar this morning looking at the gas-meter I\nsaw two big boxes full of potatoes, a can of French pease, and a bottle\nof sarsaparilla, and if they don't like what they get it will be because\nthey are exacting. And I'll wager you from what I know of their manners\nthat if you gave them dried apples, cold tongue, and milk they'd say it\nwas the most delightful repast they ever sat down to.\"\n\n\"But _I'd_ know they didn't mean it,\" said Mrs. Idiot, smiling in spite\nof her woe. \"And that brings up the question, why should your conscience be\ntroubled by the insincerity of others?\" said he. \"Now, I'll tell you\nwhat we'll do. You fry the potatoes and I'll boil the can of pease; I\nthink four minutes will boil them hard, like an egg, and together we'll\nput the sarsaparilla on ice, and bluff the whole thing through. Bluffing\nwas always my strong point, and I have noticed, my dear, that in\nwhatever I have tried to do since we were married you have contributed\nat least ninety per cent. to success. My bluff plus your efforts to make\nthe thing a go will send our dinner to a premium.\"\n\nMrs. Idiot remained properly silent. As a matter of fact, she was not\neven listening. She was considering. What on earth to do was the\nquestion in her mind, and it so entirely absorbed it that she\nfortunately had little left for the rather easy views of the Idiot\nhimself. \"What is a dinner, anyhow?\" the Idiot added, after the silence had to\nhis mind become oppressive. \"Is it a mere meal? Do the Poet and Mr. and\nMrs. Pedagog and Mr. Whitechoker come here merely to get something to\neat? Or do they come for the pleasure of our society, or for the\npleasure of leaving home, or what? As I understand it, people go out to\ndine not because they have not a sufficiency of food at home, but\nbecause they wish to meet other people. That's what I do. I can always\nhave something better to eat at home than I can get at somebody else's\nhouse; and furthermore, it is a more natural meal.",

Dinners generally are\nmade up of pretty little things that nobody likes, and have no\nsustenance in them. A successful dinner lies not in successful cooking,\nbut in pleasing conversation. Wherefore, it is not the cook, but the\nhost and hostess who make a failure or a success of a dinner.\"\n\n\"Then I presume if we simply spread the table and let you talk our\nguests will be satisfied?\" said Mrs. Idiot, blandly. \"Precisely,\" the Idiot replied. \"It will be delightful. Just think of\nthe menu! Instead of oysters I will indulge in a few opinions as to the\nintellectual qualities of bivalves generally, finishing up with a\nglowing tribute to the man who is content to be a clam and not talk too\nmuch. In the place of _pur\u00e9e_ we will tackle some such subject as the\nfuture of Spain. I think I could ladle out a few sound ideas on that\nsubject that would be as clear as the purest _consomm\u00e9_. Then for fish,\nthat would be easy. A good trout story, with imagination sauce, would do\nvery well. For the _entr\u00e9e_ I will give you one of my most recent poems,\nand the roast will be--\"\n\n\"And the rest of us are to sit and twiddle our thumbs while you\nsoliloquize?\" demanded Mrs. Idiot. \"I rather think not. I will provide\nthe roast, my dear John, and it will consist largely of remarks upon the\nways of cooks.\"\n\n\"A very proper subject for a roast,\" observed the Idiot, complacently,\n\"and in your present frame of mind I think it will be not only well\ndone, but rare as well, with plenty of crisp. And so we can simply talk\nthis dinner through. It will be novel, certainly, and if you provide\nplenty of bread and butter no one need go away hungry.\"\n\n\"Very true,\" Mrs. Idiot answered. \"And now that you have had your fun,\nsuppose we put our minds on the serious aspect of the case. Two hours\nfrom now four people are coming here hungry--\"\n\n\"I have it!\" cried the Idiot, delightedly. \"Let's _borrow_ a cook! I\ndon't believe it's ever been done before. It would be splendid, not\nonly in getting us out of our troubles, but in establishing an entirely\nnew principle in domestic science. What is the use of neighbors who will\nnot be neighborly and lend you their most cherished possession?\"\n\n\"None at all,\" sighed Mrs. Idiot, despairingly. [Illustration: \"'THE PEOPLE DOWN-STAIRS BORROWED OUR DINING-ROOM\nCHAIRS'\"]\n\n\"Now, when we lived in our flat in New York the people up-stairs\nborrowed our ice,\" said the Idiot; \"the people down-stairs borrowed our\ndining-room chairs; the people across the hall borrowed butter and milk\nand eggs, and I think we once borrowed a lemon from the people on the\ntop floor.\"\n\n\"Never!\" cried Mrs. Idiot. \"Yes, we did, my dear,\" insisted the Idiot. \"At least I did. You and the\nchildren were off in the country, and one hot summer's night, two years\nago, I was consumed with a desire for a glass of lemonade, and as there\nwere no lemons in the house, or the flat, I sent out to borrow. I began\nat the basement and worked up towards the roof, and ultimately got what\nI wanted, although, as I have said, it was the top-flat people I got it\nfrom.\"\n\n\"And did you ever return it?\" demanded Mrs. Idiot. \"I regret to say that I didn't,\" said the Idiot. \"But I will, and with\ninterest. I wonder what two years' interest on a lemon is!\" he added. \"I\nsuppose that a borrowed lemon compounded at the rate of six per cent. could be paid off by a lemon and one small Bermuda potato. I will send\nmy check for both to those people to-morrow. What was their name?\"\n\n\"I never knew,\" said Mrs. Idiot. \"I never liked them, and I never\ncalled. I am sorry you are under obligations to them.\"\n\n\"Only for a lemon, though, dear,\" said the Idiot, \"at six per cent.\"\n\n\"But what does all this prove?\" demanded the poor little housekeeper. \"That the principle of lending is recognized among neighbors,\" the Idiot\nexplained. \"If a neighbor will lend a lemon, surely a neighbor will lend\na cook. The principle involved is the same in both cases. Particularly\nso in this case, for my experience with cooks has been that they are,\nafter all, for the most part nothing but human lemons. If the departed\nBridget had been anything but full of sourness she would not have left\nus so unexpectedly.\"\n\n\"You don't really think for a moment, do you, that the Jimpsonberrys\nwould lend us their cook, or that she would come, or that I would ask\nthem?\" said Mrs. Idiot. \"Well, I suppose not,\" said the Idiot. \"I suppose not.",

Second, we don't ask their cook to come for\nnothing. By coming she will receive an addition to her wages which will\nhelp her to endow a policeman with a moderate fortune some day when she\nmarries him. As for your asking Mrs. Jimpsonberry to lend us her cook\nfor a few hours, that is the main objection. When one borrows one must\ngive collateral, and it may be that it would embarrass you to offer Mike\nas security for the safe return of the Jimpsonberrys' cook. Anyhow, I\nsee weak points in my plan, and we'd better abandon it. If the\nJimpsonberrys' cook is the only available incendiary in the\nneighborhood, we'd better stop where we are. When we dined at\nJimpsonberrys' last week I went away feeling that Jimpsonberry ought to\ncollect fire insurance on that dinner. It wasn't cooked; it was a plain\ncase of arson.\"\n\nIt was at this precise moment, when poor Mrs. Idiot was beginning to\ndespair of getting any advice of value from her husband, that the\ntelephone-bell rang, and the Idiot rose up to answer the call. \"Hello!\" he said. \"Oh! Hello, old man!\" he added. \"That you? Glad to see you.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he continued, after a pause. \"Of course we expect you.\"\n\n\"Seven o'clock sharp,\" he remarked, a moment later. \"You'll surely be\nhere?\" Then after a second pause, he added:\n\n\"Good! You can stay all night if you wish; we've plenty of room. Good-bye.\"\n\n\n\n\"Who was it?\" asked Mrs. Idiot, as the Idiot hung up the receiver of the\ntelephone. \"The Poet,\" replied the Idiot. \"He wanted to know at what hour dinner\nwas.\"\n\n\"Oh, dear!\" cried Mrs. Idiot. \"Why didn't you tell him the dinner isn't\nfor to-night, but to-morrow night?\"\n\n\"Didn't need to, my dear,\" said the Idiot, lighting a cigarette. \"We've\nmade a slight mistake. You invited these people, it now appears, for the\ntwenty-ninth.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Mrs. Idiot. \"Well, my love,\" said the Idiot, with an affectionate glance, \"to-day is\nthe--ah--the twenty-eighth.\"\n\nMrs. Idiot drew a sigh of relief. \"My!\" she cried, \"what a blessing! I wonder how I got so mixed!\"\n\n\"It's economy, perhaps,\" suggested the Idiot. \"If you will insist on\nbuying out-of-date diaries and last year's calendars at bargain-counters\nbecause they are cheap, I don't really see how you can expect to keep up\nwith the times.\"\n\nMrs. Idiot laughed heartily. Her relief of mind was unmistakable. \"What would you have done, John, if this had really been the night?\" she\nasked later. \"Oh, I don't know,\" said the Idiot. \"I think I should have taken you to\nNew York to dinner, and bluffed our guests into believing they had come\nup on the wrong night. It is very easy for a host to put his guests in\nthe wrong if he wants to. I don't, but if I must, I must.\"\n\nAs it was, the family dinner that night was a great success in spite of\nthe absence of the cook, because Mrs. Idiot, who is an expert with the\nchafing-dish, found several odds and ends in the late cook's domains,\nwhich, under her expert manipulation, became dishes which the Idiot said\nafterwards \"remained long in the memory without proving too permanent a\ntax upon the digestion.\"",

    "text": "V\n\nON THE MAINTENANCE OF AN ATTIC\n\nThe Idiot had been laid up for a week. That is to say, he was too\nindisposed to attend to business at his office, and the family physician\nthought it would be a good idea if his patient would be content to\nremain quietly indoors for a little while. To this the Idiot cheerfully\nconsented. \"If there is one thing that I can do to perfection,\" he said, \"it is\nresting. Some men are born leisurely, some achieve leisure, and some are\ndischarged by their employers. I belong to the first two classes. I can\nnever become one of the third class, because, being my own employer, I\nam naturally pleased with myself, and am not likely to dispense with my\nown services.\"\n\nAnd so he stayed at home, and for a week pottered about the house, as he\nput it, and he had a glorious time. \"What are you going to do with yourself this morning, dear?\" asked Mrs. Idiot on the morning of the first day. \"I've got to go to market, and\nthere are one or two other little things to be attended to which will\nkeep me out for some hours. Do you think you can amuse yourself while I\nam out?\"\n\n\"Well, I don't know,\" said the Idiot. \"I can try. Of course, you know,\nmy dear, that I am a good deal of a baby yet. However, if you can trust\nme to stay all by my lonesome for two or three hours I'll try to behave. I promise not to take the piano apart, and I vow I won't steal any jam,\nand I sha'n't float hair-brushes in the bath-tub pretending that they\nare armored cruisers looking for Spaniards, and I'll try to be good, but\nI can't make any promises.\"\n\nMrs. Idiot smiled, as an indulgent guardian should, and went forth. The\nIdiot stayed at home and enjoyed himself. What he did is perhaps best\nindicated by his remarks some time later at a Sunday-night tea at which\nMr. and Mrs. Pedagog, and Mr. Brief, the lawyer, were present. \"Mrs. Pedagog,\" said the Idiot, \"did you ever have an attic?\"\n\n\"A what?\" demanded the Schoolmaster, naturally somewhat nonplussed. \"An attic,\" said the Idiot. \"A favored spot wherein to potter, to root,\nto rummage.\"\n\n\"Why, yes,\" said Mrs. Pedagog, after a moment of deliberation. \"I have\nhad an attic, but it never seemed to me to be a particularly interesting\nspot. I've used it as a sort of store-room for things I didn't know what\nto do with.\"\n\n\"Useless things,\" suggested Mr. Pedagog. \"Entirely so,\" acquiesced the good lady. \"Then if they are useless, why keep them?\" queried the Idiot. \"Useless\nthings might better be thrown away than stored away even in an attic.\"\n\n\"Oh, as for that,\" rejoined Mrs. Pedagog, \"they were useless in the\nsense that there was nothing I could do with them, and yet there was\ngenerally some quality of association or something about them that so\nappealed to me that I couldn't quite throw them away, or even bring\nmyself to give them away.\"\n\n\"That is the idea,\" said the Idiot. \"One's cherished possessions are\noften stored away up-stairs and forgotten, and then sometimes years\nafter you'll go rummaging about the house for lack of some other\nemployment; an old trunk, a wooden box, will be unearthed in the attic,\nand then what a flood of memories will come rushing back over you as the\nlong-forgotten objects come to light, one by one.\"\n\n\"I have had much the same experience,\" said Mr. Brief, \"in what I might\nterm my professional attic. We keep a room for the storage of old\npapers, and strange exhibits in litigation turn up there frequently that\nbring back old-time lawsuits in a most interesting fashion.\"\n\n\"I suppose, then,\" observed Mr. Pedagog, with a shrug of tolerant\ncontempt, \"that the attic is, in your estimation, a sort of repository\nfor family archives.\"\n\n\n\n\"That's about it,\" said the Idiot. \"You ought to see mine. There are\narchives from the Ark in mine. I've got all the portraits of my\nunpopular relatives up there, and such a gallery of smug-looking\nindividuals you never saw. There's Uncle Jedediah, who hated me because\nI set off a giant cracker under his chair one Fourth of July, and who\nfrom that day vowed I was born to be hanged; and who sent me a crayon\nportrait of himself the following Christmas--\"\n\n\"That seems to me to show a kindly feeling, not one of hatred, towards\nyou,\" suggested Mrs. Pedagog. \"Oh no,\" said the Idiot, with a laugh. \"You never knew my dear old Uncle\nJed.

He had to send something,\nand he picked out the one thing he had reason to know I didn't want; and\nhe was likewise aware that my mother had a sense of the proprieties and\nwould hang that portrait upon the wall of my bedroom, whence it could\nstare at me, disapprovingly, forevermore.

It\nreally was very affecting.\"\n\nMr. Pedagog gazed at the Idiot fondly. \"You are a great boy,\" he said. \"You'd never suspect it, but I had a\nsimilar case of Uncle Jed, but the years I have lived since have\nsoftened my feelings so that I remember my old relative with a certain\ndegree of affection.\"\n\n\"I shall never believe, my dear John,\" said Mrs. Pedagog, \"that in your\nday boys ever placed giant crackers under their uncles' chairs.\"\n\n\"We never did, my love,\" Mr. Pedagog responded, quickly. \"Why, of course not,\" laughed the Idiot. \"They couldn't, you know. They\nhadn't been invented. What was your trouble with Uncle Jed, Mr. Pedagog?\"\n\n\"Oh, our difference of opinion was rather of an ethical import,\" replied\nMr. Pedagog, genially. \"My Uncle Jed was a preacher, and he used to\nspeak entirely from notes which he would make out the night before and\nplace in the pocket of his black coat. All I did was to take the notes\nof his next day's sermon out of his pocket one Saturday evening, and put\nin their stead a--ah--a recipe for what we called Washington pie--and a\nvery good pie it was.\"\n\n\"John!\" ejaculated Mrs. Pedagog. [Illustration: \"'STARTED TO PREACH WITH THE RECIPE FOR A WASHINGTON\nPIE'\"]\n\n\"I _did_, my dear,\" confessed the Schoolmaster, \"and really I have never\nregretted it, although my particular uncle gave me a distressingly acrid\nand dreary lecture on my certain future when he found out what had\nhappened. Yet what did happen, though mischievously intended, resulted\nin great good, for when the dear old gentleman stood up in the pulpit\nand started to preach the next morning, with the recipe for a Washington\npie as the only available note at hand, he pulled himself together and\npreached off-hand the finest sermon of his life, and he discovered then\nthe secret of his after-success. He became known ultimately as one of\nthe most brilliant preachers of his time, and from that moment never\nwent into the pulpit with any factitious aids to his memory.\"\n\n\"You mean cribs, don't you?\" asked the Idiot. \"That is what college-boys call them, I believe,\" said Mr. Pedagog. \"I\nwill say further that a year before he died _my_ Uncle Jed told me that\nit was my mischievous act that had given him the hint which became\nthe keynote of his eloquence,\" he added, complacently. \"I shall always\nremember him affectionately.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said the Idiot. \"No doubt we all remember our Uncle Jeds\naffectionately. I certainly do. He was my mother's brother, and he meant\nwell. I never really blamed him for not knowing how to sympathize with a\nboyish prank, because there has never been a school of instructions for\nuncles. Unclehood is about the hardest hood man has to wear, and as I\nhave observed uncles and their habits, they either spoil or repel the\nsmall chaps and chappesses who happen to be made their nephews and\nnieces by an accident of birth. Uncles are either intensely genial or\nintensely irritable, and as far as I am concerned it is my belief that\nour colleges should include in their curriculum a chair of 'Uncleism.'\nUnclehood is a relationship that man has to accept. It is thrust upon\nhim. He can't help himself. To be a father or a mother is a matter of\nvolition. But even in a free country like our own, if a man has a\nbrother or a sister he is liable to find himself an uncle at any time\nwhether he wishes to be one or not. Then when it happens he's got to\nreason out a course of procedure without any basis in previous\nexperience.\"\n\n\"Why don't you write a book on 'Hints to Uncles,' or 'The Complete\nAunt,'\" suggested Mr. Brief. \"I have no doubt it would make good\nreading.\"\n\n\"Thanks for the idea,\" said the Idiot. \"I think I'll do it. Not in the\nhope of profit, but for the benefit of the race.\"\n\n\"What has all this to do with attics?\" asked Mrs. Idiot. \"The natural resting-place of the bad uncle,\" explained the Idiot. \"Still, I maintain that it is every man's duty to keep an attic for the\nuseless things, as Mrs. Pedagog calls them, which some day, when he\nleast expects it, will carry his mind back to other days. The word\nitself, attic, carries the mind back to the splendors of Athens and\nother things that are out of date. When I was ill I found sincerest\npleasure in rummaging.

You can't rummage in a library if your library is\nproperly looked after. You can't rummage in a bedroom in a well-kept\nhouse. You all know what parlors are--designed largely for the\nreception of people who come out to call upon you in their best Sunday\nclothes, and who would never think of calling upon you intimately, as a\nfriend might, in his knickerbockers. You can't rummage there. The only\nplace where one may rummage with any degree of success is in the attic,\nand my experience has been such that I believe my recent illness has\ncontributed to my health. My mind has been carried back to conditions\nthat used to be. Conditions which existed then and which were inferior\nto conditions which now prevail make me satisfied with the present. Where old-time conditions were better than the existing one I have\nnaturally discovered how to improve. Rummaging, therefore, is improving\nto the mind and contributes to one's contentment.\"\n\n\n\n\"Then there are good economical reasons for the maintenance of an\nattic,\" the Idiot continued. \"I found enough old boyhood collections of\nvarious things there to keep Tommy and Mollie happy for years without my\nhaving to pay out a penny for birthday presents--old stamps, old coins,\nold picture papers, and, I assure you, a lot of old newspapers, too,\nwith better and more readable news in them than is now to be found in\nany of our modern bilious journals. Then the bundles of letters that\ncame out of that place--my mother's letters to me, written while I was\naway at school; my father's letters in the old days at your house, Mrs. Pedagog, which did much to keep me straight then and re-reading of which\ndoesn't hurt now; and, best of all,\" he added, with an affectionate\nglance at Mrs. Idiot, \"a little bundle of my own letters to a certain\nperson tied up with a blue ribbon, and full of pressed roses and autumn\nleaves and promises--\"\n\n\"In the attic?\" asked Mr. Brief, with a dry smile. \"Is that where Mrs. Idiot keeps your promises?\"\n\nMrs. Idiot blushed. \"I have a cedar chest full of treasures up there,\"\nshe said. \"I thought it was locked.\"\n\n\"Well, anyhow, I found them,\" said the Idiot, cheerfully; \"and while\nthey were not especially good reading, they were good reminders of other\ndays. It wouldn't be a bad idea if every married man were to read over\nthe letters of his days of courtship once a year. I think it would bring\nback more forcibly than anything else the conditions of the contract\nwhich he was inviting the young partner of his joys to sign. If an attic\nnever held anything but bundles of one's old love-letters it would\ndemonstrate its right to become an institution.\"\n\n\"Very true,\" said the lawyer; \"but,\" he added, prompted by that cautious\nspirit which goes always with the professional giver of advice, \"suppose\nthat side by side with that little bundle of pressed flowers and autumn\nleaves and promises one should chance to find another little bundle of\npressed flowers and autumn leaves and promises--the promises written by\nsome other hand than the hand that is rummaging in the cedar chest? What\nthen? Would that prove a pleasing find?\"\n\n\"Oh, as for that,\" the Idiot remarked, \"when I advocate the maintenance\nof an attic as one of the first duties of mankind, I mean its\nintelligent maintenance. The thing which makes of the British Museum,\nthe National Attic of Great Britain, a positive educational force is its\nintelligent direction. It is the storehouse of the useless possessions\nof the British Empire which have an inspiring quality. There is nothing\nin it which makes a Briton think less of himself or which in any way\nunpleasantly disturbs his equanimity. So with the attic of the humble\ncitizen. It must be intelligently directed if it is to become an\ninstitution, and should not be made the repository of useless things\nwhich ought to be destroyed, among which I class that other possible\nbundle to which you refer.\"\n\nAnd inasmuch as the whole party agreed to the validity of this\nproposition, the subject was dropped, and the Idiot and his guests\nwandered on to other things.",

    "text": "VI\n\nTHE IDIOT'S GARDEN\n\n\"I should think, my dear Idiot,\" Mr. Pedagog observed one summer\nevening, as his host stood upon the back piazza of \"Castle Idiot,\" as\nthey had come to call the dwelling-place of their friend, \"that with all\nthis space you have about you, you would devote some of it to a garden.\"\n\n\"Why, I do,\" said the Idiot. \"I've got a small patch down there behind\nthe tennis-court, fifty by one hundred feet, under cultivation. The\nstuff we get is almost as good as the average canned goods, too. We had\na stalk of asparagus the other night that was magnificent as far as it\nwent. It was edible for quite a sixteenth of an inch, or at least I was\ntold so. That portion of it had already been nibbled off by my son\nThomas while it was resting in the pantry waiting to be served. However, the inedible end which arrived was quite sturdy, and might have\nstood between my family and starvation if the necessity had arisen.\"\n\n\"One stalk of asparagus is a pretty poor crop, I should say,\" observed\nthe lawyer, with a laugh. \"You might think so,\" said the Idiot. \"But everything in the world is\ncomparative, after all. Ants build ant-hills which are several feet\nlower than the Alps, and yet they are monumental, considering that they\nwere made by ants. All things considered, Mrs. Idiot and I were proud of\nour asparagus crop, and distinctly regretted that it did not survive to\nbe served in proper state at dinner. If I remember rightly, Thomas was\nseverely reprimanded for his privateering act in biting off the green\nend of it before I had a chance to see it.\"\n\n\"'Twasn't specially good,\" said Tommy, loftily. \"I am very glad it was not, my son,\" said the Idiot. \"I should be very\nsorry to hear that you had derived the slightest sensation of pleasure\nfrom your piratical and utterly inexcusable act.\"\n\n\"Do you usually serve so small a portion of the product of your\ngarden?\" asked Mr. Brief. \"Sometimes we don't serve anything at all from it,\" said the Idiot,\n\"which you will observe is smaller yet. In this instance Mrs. Idiot\nintended a little surprise for me. We had struggled with that\nasparagus-bed for some time. The madame had studied up asparagus in her\nbotany. I had looked it up in the cyclopedia and the Century dictionary. We had ordered it in various styles when we dined out at the New York\nhotels, and we had frequently bought cans of it in order to familiarize\nourselves more intimately with its general personal appearance. Then we\nconsulted people we thought would be likely to know how to obtain the\nbest results, and what they told us to do we did, but somehow it didn't\nwork. Our asparagus crop languished. We sprinkled it in person. We put\nall sorts of garden cosmetics on it to improve its complexion, but it\nseemed hopeless, and finally when I footed up the asparagus item in my\naccount-book, and discovered that we had paid out enough money without\nresults of a satisfactory nature to have kept us in canned asparagus for\nfour years, we got discouraged, and resolved to give it up. It was\nwhile Michael, our gardener, was removing the evidences of our failure\nthat he discovered the one perfect stalk, and like the honest old\ngardener that he is, he immediately brought it into the house and\npresented it to my wife. She naturally rejoiced that our efforts had not\nbeen entirely vain, and in her usual spirit of self-sacrifice had the\nstalk cooked as a surprise for me. As I have told you, that small\ncircumstance Thomas, over which we seem to have no control, got ahead of\nus--\"\n\n\"You was surprised, wasn't you, pa?\" demanded the boy. \"Somewhat, my son,\" said the Idiot, \"but not in the way your mother had\ndesigned, exactly.\"\n\n\"Is asparagus the extent of your gardening?\" queried Mrs. Pedagog. \"Oh no, indeed!\" replied Mrs. Idiot. \"We've had peas and beets and beans\nand egg-plant and corn--almost everything, in fact, including potatoes.\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" said the Idiot, \"almost everything, including potatoes. Our pea crop was lovely. We had five podfuls for dinner on the Fourth of\nJuly, and the children celebrated the day by podding them for the\ncook. They popped open almost as noisily as a torpedo. It was really\nvery enjoyable. Indeed, one of the results of that pea crop has been to\ngive me an idea by which I may some day redeem my losses on the\nasparagus-bed. An explosive pea which should be edible, and yet would\npop open with the noise of a small fire-cracker, would be a delight to\nthe children and serviceable for the table. I don't exactly know how to\nbring about the desired results, but it seems to me if I were to mix a\nlittle saltpetre in the water with which we irrigate our pea-trees the\nrequired snap would be obtained. Then on the Fourth of July the\nchildren, instead of burning their fingers and filling their parents\nwith nervous dread setting off fire-crackers, could sit out on the back\npiazza and shell the peas for the cook--\"\n\n\"I'd rather shell Spangyards,\" said Mollie. \"I am surprised at you, my child,\" said the Idiot. \"A little girl like\nyou should be an advocate of peace, not of war.\"\n\n\"You can't eat Spaniards, either, can you, pa?\" said Tommy, who, while\nhe shared Mollie's views as to the comparative value for shelling\npurposes of peas and Spaniards, was nevertheless quite interested in the\ndevelopment of a pea-pod that would open with a bang. \"No, Tommy,\" said the Idiot, \"you can't eat Spaniards, and they'd be\nsure to disagree with you if you could.\"\n\n\"That is a very interesting proposition of yours,\" said Mr. Brief, \"but\nit has its dangers.",

A dynamite pea would prove very attractive so long\nas its explosive qualities were confined to the pod and its opening. But\nhow are you going to keep the saltpetre out of the peas themselves?\"\n\n\"That is where the difficulty comes in,\" said the Idiot. \"I frankly\ndon't know how we could insulate the peas from the effects of the\nsaltpetre.\"\n\n[Illustration: \"'IT WOULD BE DEUCEDLY AWKWARD ... IF THEY WOULD EXPLODE\nIN THE MOUTH OF THE PERSON WHO WAS EATING THEM'\"]\n\n\"It would be deucedly awkward,\" observed the Bibliomaniac, \"if, as might\nvery well happen, one or two of the peas should become so thoroughly\nimpregnated with the stuff that they would explode in the mouth of the\nperson who was eating them, like bombs in miniature.\"\n\n[Illustration: \"'SHE COULD SLAM THEM DOWN ON THE HEARTH-STONES LIKE\nTORPEDOES'\"]\n\n\"True,\" said the Idiot. \"The only safeguard against that would be to\ncompel the cook to test every pea before she cooked it. She could\nslam them down on the hearth-stone like torpedoes, and every one that\ndidn't go off could be cooked and served with safety. Still, there would\nbe danger even then. A careless cook might forever ruin the tooth of a\nfavored guest. I guess I'd better give up the idea.\"\n\n\"Oh, don't, pa!\" cried Tommy, his interest in explosive vegetables\nworked up to a high pitch. \"I'll test 'em all for you, and if they work\nI don't see why you couldn't raise dynamite punkins!\"\n\n\"It would be a strong temptation, my son,\" said the Idiot, \"which is all\nthe more reason why I should abandon the plan. A dynamite punkin, as you\ncall it, would wreck the whole neighborhood if one should set it off\nproperly. No, we will, after all, confine our attention to vegetables of\na more pacific nature. The others might prove more profitable at first,\nbut when the novelty of them wore off, and one realized only their\ndanger, a great deal of the pleasure one derives from eating fresh\nvegetables would be utterly destroyed.\"\n\nTommy looked out over the railing of the piazza, deep regret and\ndisappointment depicted in his brown little face; but if the glitter of\nhis eyes meant anything it meant that the idea of putting vegetables on\na war footing was not going to be allowed to drop into oblivion; and if\nthe small youth progresses in inventive genius in a fair ratio to his\npast achievements in that line, I have no doubt that if a Vesuvian\npumpkin _can_ be produced at all, the day will dawn when Thomas is\nhailed as its inventor. \"Is it true,\" asked Mr. Brief, \"that home-raised peas are sweeter than\nany other?\"\n\n\"We think so,\" said Mrs. Idiot. \"We know so,\" amended the Idiot. \"That Fourth-of-July night when we ate\nthose five podfuls we discovered that fact. Five podfuls of peas are not\nenough to feed a family of four on, so we mixed them in with a few more\nthat we bought at the grocer's, and we could tell ours from the others\nevery time, they were so much sweeter.\"\n\nThe Bibliomaniac laughed scornfully. \"Pooh!\" said he. \"How did you know that they were yours that were sweet,\nand not the grocery-bought peas?\"\n\n\"How does a father know his own children?\" said the Idiot. \"If you'd\nlabored over those five pods as hard and assiduously as we did, nursing\nthem through their infant troubles, guarding them against locusts and\npotato-bugs, carefully watching their development from infancy into the\nfull vigor of a mature peahood, I guess you'd know your own from those\nof others. It's instinct, my dear Bibliomaniac.\"\n\n\"Tell about the strawberry, pa,\" said Tommy, who liked to hear his\nfather talk, in which respect I fear he takes strongly after his parent. \"Well,\" said the Idiot, \"it's not much of a story. There was one. We had\na strawberry patch twenty feet by ten. We had plenty of straw and plenty\nof patch, but the berries were timid about appearing. The results were\nsimilar to those in our asparagus venture. One berry was discovered\ntrying to hide itself under half a bale of straw one morning, and while\nI was looking for Mrs. Idiot, to ask her to come down to the garden and\nsee it grow, a miserable robin came along and bit its whole interior\nout. I hope the bird enjoyed it, because on a bed-rock estimate that\nberry cost twenty dollars. That is one of the things about gardening\nthat make me especially weary. One doesn't mind spending forty-four\ndollars on a stalk of asparagus that is eaten, even surreptitiously, by\na member of one's own family; but to pay twenty dollars for a strawberry\nto be wasted on a fifteen-cent robin is, to say the least, irritating.\"\n\n\"You forget, John,\" said Mrs.",

You were so blue about the loss of our one beautiful berry\nthat I entered into a conspiracy with Michael to make that patch yield. The fifteen boxes of berries that we took out subsequently were bought\nat a New York fruit-store and judiciously scattered about the patch\nwhere you would find them. I had hoped you would never find it out, but\nwhen you spoke the other day of expending thirty-eight dollars on that\nstrawberry-patch next year, I resolved then to undeceive you. This is\nthe first favorable opportunity I have had.\"\n\nMrs. Idiot laughed heartily. \"I knew it all along,\" she said. \"Michael\ncame to me with them and asked for instructions as to where to put them. Really, I--ah--I arranged them under the straw myself.\"\n\n\"What an ass a hired man can be!\" ejaculated the Idiot. \"I shall\ndischarge Michael to-morrow.\"\n\n\"I wish you would,\" said Mrs. Idiot. \"Ever since the conspiracy he has\nbeen entirely too independent.\"\n\n\"Don't discharge Michael, papa,\" said Mollie. \"He's awful nice. He's\nalways willin' to stop anything he's doing to play with Tommy and me.\"\n\n\"You bet he is!\" cried Tommy. \"He's a dandy, Mike is. He never says a\nword when I sit under the sprinkler, and he told me the other day that\nhis grandfather would have been king of Ireland if Queen Victoria hadn't\ncome in. He said the Queen was a lady, and his grandfather gave up his\nseat to her because he was a gentleman and couldn't do anything else.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said the Idiot, suavely. \"Then I won't discharge Michael. One feels a better American, a better Republican, if he has a royal\npersonage in his employ. I always wondered where Michael got his\nimperious manner; now I know. As a descendant of a long line of kings it\ncould not be otherwise. I will give him another chance. But let me give\nyou all fair warning. If next summer Michael does not succeed in\nproducing from my garden four beets, ten pods of peas, three\nstring-beans, and less than ten thousand onions, he goes. I shall not\npay a gardener forty dollars a month unless he can raise three dollars'\nworth of vegetables a year.\"\n\n\"But really,\" said Mr. Pedagog, \"haven't you raised anything in your\ngarden?\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\" said the Idiot. \"I've raised my water bill in the garden. I\nused to pay twelve dollars a quarter for water, but now the bills come\nto at least twenty-five dollars. Truly, a garden is not without profit\nto some one.\"",

    "text": "VII\n\nHOUSEHOLD POETRY\n\n\"Yes,\" said the Idiot, in response to an inquiry from the Poet, who was\npassing a Sunday with him at Castle Idiot, \"I have found that there is a\ngreat deal of poetry in the apparently uninspiring little things of a\nhousehold. There is to me as much poetry in a poker as there is in a\nsnow-clad Alp, if you only have an eye to find it; and I am sure that to\nthousands of housewives the whole land over a sonnet to a clothes-pin,\nwritten by one who knows the clothes-pin's nature intimately, would be\nfar more appealing than a similar number of lines trying to prove that\nwe are all miserable phantoms flitting across a morass of woe.\"\n\nThe Poet pulled away thoughtfully at his pipe. He was a broad-minded\npoet, and while he had never owned a poker of his own, he was ready to\nadmit its possibilities; but he could not follow his friend closely\nenough to admit that it contained as much that was inspiring as did Mont\nBlanc, for instance, a bright particular Alp of which he was very fond. The Idiot continued:\n\n\n\n\"A ton of coal contains far more warmth than a woman's eyebrow; sends\nthe mind of a thoughtful person chasing backward to the time when it lay\nsnugly hid in the fair breast of nature; to the joys and woes of the\ntoilers who mined it; through a variety of complexities of life, every\none of them fraught with noble thoughts. Yet who ever wrote dainty\nverses to a ton of coal, and who hasn't at one time or another in his\nlife written about the eyebrows of some woman?\"\n\nThe Poet laughed this time. \"A triolet to a ton of coal would be a\nglorious thing now, wouldn't it?\" he observed. \"No,\" said the Idiot. \"A triolet could never be a glorious thing under\nany circumstances; but to the extent that a ton of coal contains a\ncertain amount of grandeur in the service it renders to mankind, I think\nthe form would be ennobled somewhat by the substance. Let's try it and\nsee.\"\n\n\"You do it,\" said the Poet; \"I really don't think I could do the\nsubject justice.\"\n\nThe Idiot got out a pencil and a pad of paper and began. \"I don't think I'll make it a triolet,\" he said, after biting the end of\nhis pencil for a few moments. \"A whole ton is a good deal to cram into a\ntriolet. I'll just make it a plain poem of the go-as-you-please variety\ninstead, eh?\"\n\n\"In the manner of Whitman, perhaps?\" suggested the Poet, dryly. \"Just so,\" said the Idiot. \"In the manner of Whitman; in fact, I think\nthe manner of Whitman is the only manner for the poetic description of a\nton of coal.\"\n\nHe began to scribble on the pad. \"I'm going to call this 'Content,'\" he said in a few moments. \"Contentment strikes me as the main lesson a ton of coal teaches.\"\n\nHe scribbled on, and in four or five minutes he put down his pencil and\nread the following lines:\n\n \"I'm glad I'm not as men are--\n Always worrying about something, and often about nothing;\n About what was and what wasn't;\n Fretting about what may be and what might have been;\n Wondering whether when they are called upon to do their duty\n They'll be able to do it,\n And generally deciding they won't,\n To their own discomfort. And if so be they're women,\n Cogitating from morn till night,\n From night till morn,\n Wherewithal shall they be clothed,\n And if their hats are on straight! Yea! I am glad I am not like one of these,\n But am myself--\n A ton of coal--jetty in my blackness and luminous in my bituminosity. Lying here in the cellar content and not bothering a bit. Not needing income or clothes, and wearing no hat, and with no\n complexion to bother about. Happy and serene about my duty,\n Certain that I shall succeed when the time for action comes;\n Knowing that I shall burn,\n And in the burning glow like the polar star. Cackling and crackling,\n Hissing and smoking,\n Full of heat,\n A satisfaction to mankind,\n And never worth less than $5.65, delivered! Ah, me! What bliss to be a ton of coal! I am content.\"\n\nThe Poet nodded his pleasure at the effort. \"It is charmingly put,\" he\nsaid. \"I must confess, my dear Idiot, that the idea of contentment is\nthe last one that I should ever have extracted from contemplation of\na binful of anthracite, and yet when I consider how you put it I wonder\nit has not occurred to every one. You have the manner of the Whitman\nparodist down fine, too.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said the Idiot. \"It is entirely natural to me. I think,\ntoo, that using the Whitman lack of form carries with it the notion of\nthe coal sliding down the chute, don't you? Coal runs into the cellar in\nsuch an irresponsible, formless way, eh?\"\n\n\"Precisely,\" smiled the Poet. \"You have the right notion about that. The\nform of a poem should really be adapted to the substance. It should be\ndescriptive, always. Tennyson's 'Charge of the Light Brigade' has in its\nrhythm nothing more or less than the clatter of the horses' hoofs as\nthey and their riders dashed through the valley of death at Balaklava. And how vividly Southey's brook comes before the mind in its mad rush\ndownward as one reads that wonderfully lyrical poem. Why don't you write\na book of household poetry? You seem to me to be eminently well\nqualified to undertake it.\"\n\n\"I intend to,\" said the Idiot. \"In fact, I've begun it already. Written\nfive or six. Like to see 'em?\"\n\n\"Indeed I should,\" said the Poet. \"Anything you do interests me.\"\n\nThe Idiot went to his desk and took from it a few pages of manuscript.",

I called it 'The Song\nof the Poker Bold.'\" And then he read these lines:\n\n \"Warder of the grate am I,\n Ever standing near;\n Poking, poking all day long,\n Knowing naught of fear. \"Keeping coals up to their work,\n Setting them aglow,\n Minding not the scorching heat,\n Rather like it so. \"Knocking ashes right and left,\n Flirting with the tiles;\n Bossing tongs and seeing that\n The brazen kettle biles. \"And the little girls and boys\n As they watch me pause,\n Wishing that I'd talk and tell\n 'Bout old Santa Claus! \"Cracking jokes with crickets on\n The merry hearth, elate;\n Happy lot indeed is mine--\n Warder of the grate!\"\n\n\"Splendid!\" cried the Poet, clapping his hands with enthusiasm. \"Splendid! A good stiff pokeresque lyric, and your characterization of\nthe poker as the 'Warder of the Grate' gives it a flavor of romance. You\ncould almost imagine the implement going out into a medi\u00e6val world in\nsearch of knightly adventure--a sort of hearth-stone Quixote. Have you\ntackled the clothes-pin yet?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the Idiot. \"Indeed, my first effort was a lyric on the\nclothes-pin. I started one night to do the contents of the\nkitchen-dresser drawer in French forms, but the first thing I took out\nwas an egg-beater, and it wouldn't go, so I did the clothes-pin lyric. I\ncall it\n\n\"FIDELITY\n\n \"Blow, ye winds,\n I fear ye not;\n Blast, ye simoon,\n Sere and hot! \"Hurricane,\n And cyclone, too,\n Blow, I have no\n Fear of you. \"Lacking beauty,\n Lacking grace,\n Lacking handsome\n Form and face;\n\n \"Lacking soul\n And intellect,\n Still I stand up,\n Proud, erect. \"For the Fates\n Have given me\n Wondrous great\n Tenacity. \"And success,\n Both fair and fine,\n Comes to him\n Who holds his line. \"Burrs can stick\n And so can glue--\n Mucilage,\n Stratena, too;\n\n \"But there's nothing\n Holds so fast\n As the clothes-pin\n To the last.\"\n\n\"And you gave up the egg-beater altogether?\" asked the Poet, restraining\na natural inclination to find flaws in the construction of the\nclothes-pin poem. \"Oh no,\" said the Idiot, \"I knocked off a little quatrain on that. I\ncalled it 'The Speedy Egg-Beater,' and it goes like this:\n\n \"Great Maude S. can beat all steeds,\n However speedy be their legs;\n But I distance her with ease\n When it comes to beating eggs.\"\n\n\"I really think that you would have done better to give up the\negg-beater,\" said the Poet, grown critical. \"I've no patience with\none-rhymed quatrains. Now if you had written:\n\n \"Great Maude S. can beat all steeds,\n However speedy be their legs;\n But despite her doughty deeds;\n I can beat her beating eggs,\n\n\"I should not have objected.\"\n\n\"I accept the amendment,\" replied the Idiot, meekly. \"I realized the\nweakness of the thing myself, and thought of changing it into a couplet,\nwhere you only need one rhyme. How's this on a 'Carpet-Tack'?\"\n\n[Illustration: \"'FOR THOUGH I'M BUT A CARPET-TACK\n\nAFAR FROM MOIL AND STRIFE,\n\nNO ONE CAN EVER TRULY SAY\n\nTHAT MINE'S A POINTLESS LIFE'\"]\n\n \"However dull the day,\n However dull the skies,\n However dark the night may be,\n My spirits ever rise. \"For though I'm but a carpet-tack,\n Afar from moil and strife,\n No one can ever truly say\n That mine's a pointless life.\"\n\n\"That is very good,\" said the Poet. \"I think almost any editor of any\ncomic paper would be willing to pay you three dollars for that. It is as\ngood as your poem on a ton of coal--simple in its expression and sweet\nin sentiment.\"\n\n\"I thought you'd think so,\" said the Idiot. \"It struck me so. I've got\none on a screw-driver, too, that is very much of the same order, and\nconveys a moral lesson to the reader who is always reaching out after\nthe unattainable. It reads as follows:\n\n \"I cannot tool a tally-ho,\n I cannot drive a nag;\n I dare not hold the ribbons\n On a hack or rumbling drag. \"I could not guide the reins upon\n A simple billy-goat,\n And I should hesitate to try\n To drive a can-al boat. \"But I don't mind these things at all,\n For I can drive a screw,\n And I am happy, for that's just\n What I was meant to do.\"\n\n\n\n\"The fourth line of the second verse is weak, but otherwise it's good,\"\ncommented the Poet. \"It's not a _can_-al boat; it's a can-_al_ boat, and\nall the poetic license in the world wouldn't excuse your taking such\na liberty with language.\"\n\n\"I appreciate that,\" said the Idiot. \"But I don't see how I could get\naround it.\"\n\n\"There's only one way,\" said the Poet. \"I think if you omitted that\nverse altogether you'd improve the poem.\"\n\n\"Then I should have to eliminate the billy-goat,\" said the Idiot. \"That\ntakes a great deal of humor out of it.",

    "text": "VIII\n\nSOME CONSIDERATION OF THE HIRED MAN\n\n\"Who is that sitting down on your tennis-court, Mr. Idiot?\" asked Mr. Brief, the lawyer. \"Or is it anybody? I've been trying for the last\nhalf-hour to make out whether it's a man or one of those iron figures\nwith which some people decorate their lawns.\"\n\n\"That,\" replied the Idiot, calmly, \"is my hired man. I pay him forty\ndollars a month to sit down there and let the grass grow under his feet. I heard you and Mr. Pedagog discussing the wonderful grassiness of my\nlawn after dinner last night, and I meant to have told you then that the\ncredit thereof belongs entirely to the restful nature of that man's\nsoul. He will stand for hours rooted to one spot and looking with\napparent aimlessness out over the river. To most people this would seem\nto be prompted by a sheer indisposition to work, but this would do him a\nrank injustice, for his immovability is due entirely to his system. He\nis letting the grass grow beneath him, and the fact that our grass is so\nnourishing everywhere is due to his having stood for hours at various\ntimes over every square inch of territory to which I hold the\ntitle-deeds.\"\n\nThe Idiot gazed out of the window at his retainer with affectionate\nadmiration. \"He certainly clings closely to his system,\" said the lawyer. [Illustration: \"'I FEEL THAT I COULD GO OUT AND MOW THREE ACRES OF\nGRASS'\"]\n\n\"He is a model,\" said the Idiot. \"He has done more to make my life here\neasy than any one in my service. For instance, you know the hurly-burly\nof existence in town. I go to my office in the morning, and whether I\nhave much work or little to do, I come home in the afternoon absolutely\nworn out. The constant hustling and bustling of others in the city wears\nupon my mind, and consequently upon my body. The rush and roar of cables\nand electric-cars; the activity of messengers running to and fro in the\nstreets; the weary horses dragging great lumbering wagons up and down\nthe crowded thoroughfares, all affect my nature and impair my energy;\nand then, the day's work done, I return here, where all is quiet and\nstill, and the very contrast between that man, standing silently on his\nappointed spot, or leaning against the house, or lying off in sheer\ncontent under some tree, and the mad scramble for lucre in the city,\ninvigorates my tired body until I feel that I could go out and mow three\nacres of grass before dinner; in fact, I generally do.\"\n\n\"I did not know that a restful nature was a requisite of a successful\ncareer as a hired man,\" said Mr. Pedagog. \"It is evident, then, that you have never had a hired man,\" rejoined the\nIdiot. \"Nor can you ever have studied the species at close range. Ceaseless activity would be his ruin. If he did to-day all there is to\ndo, he would be out of employment to-morrow, consequently he never does\nto-day's work to-day, and cultivates that leisurely attitude towards\nlife upon which you have commented. Do you see that small beech-tree\nover there?\" he added, pointing to a scrawny little sapling whose sole\nvirtue appeared to be its rigid uprightness. \"Is that a beech-tree?\" asked Mr. Brief. \"I thought it was a garden\nstake.\"\n\n\n\n\"It is a beech-tree,\" said the Idiot. \"I planted it myself last autumn,\nand while it has as yet borne no beeches, I think if we give it time,\nand it withstands the rigors of the climate, it will produce its fruit. But it was not of its possibilities as a beech-bearing tree that I\nintended to speak. I wanted to indicate to you by a material object the\nvalue of having a hired man who likes to lean against things. At the\nclose of this last winter that tree, instead of being as erect as a\ngrenadier, as it now is, was all askew. The strong westerly winds which\nare constantly blowing across that open stretch bent the thing until it\nseemed that the tree was bound to be deformed; but Mike overcame the\ndifficulty. He would go out day after day and sit down beside it and\nlean against it for two and three hours at a time, with the result that\nthe tendency to curve was overcome, and a tree that I feared was doomed\nto fail now bids fair to resemble a successful telegraph-pole in its\nuprightness. And, of course, the added warmth of his body pressing down\nupon the earth which covers its roots gave it an added impulse to\ngrow.\"\n\n\"It is a wonderful system,\" smiled Mr. Brief. \"I wonder it is not\nadopted everywhere.\"\n\n\"It is, pretty much,\" said the Idiot. \"Most hired men do the same thing. I don't think Mike differs radically from others of his kind. Of course,\nthere are exceptions. My neighbor Jimpsonberry, for instance, has a man\nwho is so infernally unrestful that he makes everybody tired. He is up\nevery morning mowing Jimpsonberry's lawn at five o'clock, waking up\nevery sleepy soul within ear-shot with the incessant and disturbing\nclicking of his machine. Mike would never think of making such a\nnuisance of himself. Furthermore, Jimpsonberry's lawn is kept so\nclose-cropped that the grass doesn't get any chance, and in the heat of\nmidsummer turns to a dull brick-red.\"\n\nAfter a pause, during which the company seemed to be deeply cogitating\nthe philosophical bearing of the subject under discussion, the Idiot\nresumed:\n\n\"There is another aspect of this matter,\" he said, \"which Jimpsonberry's\nman brings to my mind. You know as well as I do that heat is\ncontagious.",

You know as well as I do that heat is\ncontagious. If you feel as cool as a cucumber, and then all of a sudden\nsee somebody who is dripping with perspiration and looking for all the\nworld like a human kettle simmering on a kitchen-range, you begin to\nsimmer yourself. It is mere sympathy, of course, but you simmer just the\nsame, get uncomfortable and hot in the collar, and are shortly as badly\noff as the other fellow. So it is with Jimpsonberry's man. Time and time\nagain he has spoiled all my pleasure by making me realize by a glance at\nhis red face and sweating arms how beastly hot it is, when before I had\nseen him I felt tolerably comfortable. Mike, on the other hand, is not\nso inconsiderate, and I am confident would let the grass grow a mile\nhigh before he would consent to interfere with my temperature by pushing\nthe mower up and down the lawn on a humid day.\"\n\n\"Do you keep this interesting specimen of still life all through the\nyear?\" asked Mr. Brief, \"or do you give him a much-needed vacation in\nwinter? I should think he would be worn out with all this standing\naround, for nothing that I know of is more tiresome than doing\nnothing.\"\n\n\"No,\" said the Idiot. \"Mike never seems to need a vacation. Sitting down\nand leaning against things and standing around don't seem to tire him in\nthe least. It might tire you or me, but you see he's used to it. The\nonly effect it has on him, as I view the matter, is that it wears out\nhis clothes. It doesn't impair his lack of vigor at all. So by the\nsimple act of occasionally renewing his wardrobe, which I do every time\nI discard a suit of my own, I revive his wasted vitality, and he does\nnot require to be sent to Europe, or to take an extended tour in the\nWhite Mountains to recuperate. I keep him all through the winter, and\nhis system is quite the same then as in summer, except that he does his\nsitting around and leaning indoors instead of in the open.\"\n\n\"I suppose he looks after the furnace and keeps the walks clear of snow\nin winter time?\" suggested Mr. Pedagog, who was beginning to take an\ninterest in this marvellously restful personage. \"Yes,\" said the Idiot; \"and he attends to the windows as well. As a\nminder of the furnace he is invaluable. My house is as cool as a\nroof-garden all through the winter, and thanks to his unwillingness to\nover-exert himself shovelling coal into the furnace, I burn only about\nhalf as much as my neighbors, and my house is never overheated. This in\nitself is an indication of the virtue of Mike's method. One-half of the\ncolds contracted by children nowadays are the result of overheated\nhouses. Mike's method gives me a cool house at very moderate expense,\nowing to the great saving of coal, the children do not get colds because\nof overheating, and the expense of having a doctor every other day is\naverted. Then his snow-shovelling scheme goes back to the first\nprinciples of nature. Mike is not overawed by convention, and instead of\nfollowing the steps of other men who shovel the snow entirely off, he\nshovels off a footpath to enable me to go to business, and then sits\ndown and oversees the sun while it melts the balance. Sometimes, if the\nsun does not do the work promptly enough to suit him, he gets up little\ncontests for the children. He divides up certain portions of the walk\ninto equal parts, and starts the small boys on a race to see which one\nwill get the portion assigned to him cleaned off first, the prize being\nsomething in the nature of an apple, which the cook orders from the\nmarket. I believe my son Thomas won ten apples last winter, although I\nam told that the Jimpsonberry boy, whose father's man is cross, and\ninsists on doing all the work himself, is the champion snow-shoveller of\nthe street.\"\n\n\"Yes, he is, pa,\" put in Tommy. \"Mike owes him 'leven apples. I only won\neight.\"\n\n\"Well, that is a very good record, Thomas,\" said the Idiot, \"and I will\nsee to it that next winter you have a brand-new snow-shovel with which\nto enter the contest.\"\n\n\"Mike lets us chop the kindling-wood, too,\" said Tommy, suddenly\nperceiving a chance to put in a good word for the genial Mike. \"I think\nhe's the nicest hired man as ever was.\"\n\n\"He'll stop anything he's doing to talk to me,\" ventured Mollie, not\nwishing to be backward in laying wreaths upon the brow of their friend. \"Yes, I have noticed that,\" said the Idiot. \"Indeed, next to his extreme\nrestfulness there is no quality that I know of in Mike that shines out\nso conspicuously as his intense love for children.",

I have frequently seen him spend a whole day on one\nwindow. His window-washing system is a very ingenious one,\nnevertheless.\"\n\n\"It is, indeed,\" said Mrs. Idiot, with a show of feeling. \"A new window-washing system?\" grinned Mr. Pedagog. \"Yes,\" said the Idiot. \"It is his own invention. He washes them on the\noutside in summer and on the inside in winter. The result is this\nopalescent glass which you see. You would hardly guess that these\nwindows are of French plate. Still, we don't mind so much. I couldn't\nask him to wash them on the outside in winter, it is so dreadfully cold,\nand in the summer, of course, they are always open, and no one, unless\nhe were disagreeable enough to go snooping about after unpleasant\ndetails, would notice that they are not immaculate.\"\n\n\"And you pay this man forty dollars for this?\" demanded Mr. Brief. \"Oh, for this and other things. I pay him two dollars a month for the\nwork he does. I pay him ten dollars a month because he's good to the\nchildren. I pay him ten dollars more for his civility, which is\nunvarying--he always puts his hat on when he comes into the house,\nhaving noticed, perhaps, that only those who are my social equals are\nentitled to appear bareheaded in my presence.\"\n\n\"And the other eighteen?\" persisted the lawyer, by nature a\ncross-examiner. \"Well, I don't grudge him that because--\" a sort of a fond light lit up\nthe Idiot's eyes as he gazed down upon Mike, still sitting on the\ntennis-court--\"I don't grudge him that other eighteen dollars because it\ncosts Mike twenty dollars a month to live; and he uses the rest of it to\nput his boy through college, so that when he grows up to be a man he\nwill be something more than a hired man.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Mr. Brief. \"Yes,\" said the Idiot; \"I found that out from a third party some time\nago, and I thought after all I'd keep him, for I know nobody else would\nhave him, and then what would become of the boy in college?\"",

I presumed that possibly you and Dick had had some kind of a falling\nout.\"\n\n\"Not a bit of it. Dick and I couldn't quarrel any more than you and\nPolly could. Perhaps as we grow older our ideals differ. Polly's rather\nanthropological in her talks, isn't she?\"\n\n\"A trifle,\" said Mrs. Idiot. \"And musical and literary and scientific.\"\n\n\"While you?\" queried the Idiot. \"Well, I'm fond of golf and--ah--well--\"\n\n\"Golf again,\" laughed the Idiot. \"I guess that's it, Bess. When a woman\nwants to talk about the origin of the species and has to hear about a\nsplendid putt, and her observations upon the sonata are invariably\ninterrupted by animadversions upon the morals of caddies, and her\ncriticisms of Browning end in a discussion of the St. Andrew's Rules,\nshe's apt to shy off into a more congenial atmosphere, don't you think?\"\n\n\"I am sure,\" retorted Mrs. Idiot, \"that while I admit I am more\ninterested in golf than in anything else outside of you and the\nchildren, I can and do talk sometimes of other things than caddies, and\nbeautiful drives, and stymies. You are very much mistaken if you think\notherwise.\"\n\n\"That is very true, my dear,\" said the Idiot. \"And nobody knows it\nbetter than I do. I've heard you talk charmingly about lots of things\nbesides stymies, and foozles, and putts, and drives, but you don't know\nanything about the men of the Stone Age, and you couldn't tell the\ndifference between a sonata and a fugue any more than I. Furthermore,\nyou have no patience with Browning, so that when Polly Dawkins asks if\nyou like _Sordello_, you are more likely than not to say that you never\nate any, but on the whole for small fish prefer whitebait.\"\n\nMrs. Idiot laughed. \"No, indeed,\" she replied. \"I'd fall back on golf if Polly mentioned\n_Sordello_ to me. You may remember that you sent it to me when we were\nengaged, and I loved you so much--then--that I read it. If I hadn't\nloved you I couldn't have done it.\"\n\n\"Well,\" smiled the Idiot, \"what did you think of it?\"\n\n\"I think Browning had a good lie, but he foozled,\" said Mrs. Idiot, with\nher eyes atwinkle, and the Idiot subsided for at least ten seconds. \"I wish you'd say that to Polly some time,\" he observed. \"It's so very\ntrue, and put with an originality which cannot but appeal to the most\nhardened of literary women.\"\n\n\"I will if I ever get the chance,\" said Mrs. Idiot. \"Suppose we make the chance?\" suggested the Idiot. \"Let's go down there\nand call to-night. I'll work the conversation up so that you can get\nthat off as an impromptu.\"\n\n\n\n\"No,\" said Mrs. Idiot. \"I don't think we'd better. In the first place,\nMrs. Whalker told me yesterday that Polly is to read a paper on Balzac\nbefore the S. F. M. E. to-morrow evening, and on Friday morning she is\nto discuss the 'Influence of Mozart on De Koven' before the Musical\nMothers' Meeting, and on Saturday afternoon she is going to have an\nanthropological tea at her house, which she is to open with some\nspeculations as to whether in the Glacial Period dudes were addicted to\nthe use of cigarettes.\"\n\n\"Great Scott!\" said the Idiot. \"This is her busy week.\"\n\n\"Tolerably so,\" said Mrs. Idiot. \"She has probably reserved this evening\nto read up on Balzac for to-morrow's essay, so I think, my dear, we'd\nbetter not go.\"\n\n\"Right as usual,\" said the Idiot. And then he added, \"Poor Dawkins, who\nis taking care of him now?\"\n\n\"I think,\" said Mrs. Idiot, \"that possibly Mrs. Dawkins has sublet the\ncontract for looking after her husband and children to the United\nStates Housekeeping Company Limited.\"\n\nThe Idiot gazed blankly at his wife, and awaited an explanation. \"An organization, my dear,\" she continued, \"formed by a number of\nwell-meaning and remorseful widows who, having lost their husbands,\nbegin to appreciate their virtues, and who, finding themselves\nsympathetic when it is too late, are devoting themselves to the husbands\nof others who are neglected. A subscription of five hundred dollars will\nsecure the supervision of all the domestic arrangements of a\nhome--marketing, engagement and discharge of domestics, house-cleaning,\nbuttons sewed on, darning done, care of flowers, wifely duties\ngenerally; for one thousand dollars they will bring up the children, and\nsee that the baby is rocked to sleep every night, and suitably\ninterested in elevating narratives and poems like Joseph's coat of many\ncolors, and Tom, Tom the Piper's Son. This enables an advanced woman\nlike Mrs. Dawkins to devote her mornings to the encyclopedias, her\nafternoons to the public libraries, and her evenings to the functions\nwhereat she may read the papers which her devotion to the encyclopedias\nand the libraries has brought forth.\"\n\n\"Excuse me, my dear Bess,\" said the Idiot, rising. \"I wish to telephone\nDr. Simmons.\"\n\n\"For what--for whom?\" demanded the lady. \"You, of course,\" returned the Idiot. \"You are developing alarming\nsymptoms. You give every indication of a bad attack of professional\nhumor. Your 'International Widows Company for the Protection and\nAmelioration of Neglected Husbandry' proves that!\"\n\nMrs. Idiot laughed again. \"Oh, I didn't say that there really is such an institution!\" she cried. \"I said that I supposed there was, for if there isn't, poor Dick Dawkins\nisn't taken care of at all.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm sorry for it all, anyhow,\" said the Idiot, seriously.",

I'll bet you she's got a ledger\nand a full set of double-entry account-books charging up calls payable\nand calls receivable.\"\n\n\"I don't see how she can get along unless she has,\" replied Mrs. Idiot. \"With all her clubs and church societies and varied social obligations\nshe needs an expert accountant to keep track of them all.\"\n\n\"I suppose a promise to read a paper on Balzac,\" put in the Idiot, \"is\nsomething like a three-months' note. It's easy to promise to pay, with\nthree months in which to prepare, but you've got to keep track of the\ndate and meet the obligation when it falls due. As for me, I'd rather\nmeet the note.\"\n\n\"That is about it,\" said Mrs. Idiot. \"If a woman goes into society\nproperly she's got to make a business of it. For instance, there are\nabout ten dances given at the club here every year. Polly is patroness\nfor every one of 'em. There are twenty-five teas during the spring and\nsummer months. Polly assists at half of them, and gives a fifth of\nthem. She's president of the King's Daughters, corresponding secretary\nof the Dorcas, treasurer of the Red Cross Society, and goodness knows\nwhat all!\"\n\n\"I can quite understand why she needs to keep accounts--social\naccounts,\" said the Idiot. \"But it's rather queer, don't you think, that\nshe has the children on her books? The idea of saying that Jimmie and\nGladys can't come to Mollie's party because Mollie hasn't been down\nthere--why, it's nonsense!\"\n\n\"No,\" said Mrs. Idiot, \"it is merely logical. Whatever Polly Dawkins\ndoes she tries to do thoroughly. I've no doubt she'll do Balzac up\ncompletely. If she keeps social books showing call balances in her favor\nor against herself she might as well go the whole thing and write the\nchildren in--only she's made a mistake, as far as we are concerned,\nunless she means to write us off without squaring up.\"\n\n\"You talk like a financier,\" said the Idiot, admiringly. \"What do you\nknow about writing off?\"\n\n\"I used to help my father with his accounts, occasionally,\" said Mrs. Idiot. \"Polly Dawkins's books ought to show a balance of one call in\nour favor. That's really the reason I'm not willing to call there\nto-night. She's so queer about it all, and, as a matter of fact, she\nowes me a call. I'm not going to overwhelm her with an added\nobligation.\"\n\n\"Ho!\" smiled the Idiot. \"You keep books yourself, eh?\"\n\n\"I keep score,\" said Mrs. Idiot. \"I learned that playing golf.\"\n\n\"It's a bad thing to keep score in golf,\" said the Idiot. \"So they say, but I find it amusing,\" she replied. \"And how many calls does Mrs. Wilkins owe you?\" demanded the Idiot. \"I don't know,\" returned the wife. \"And I don't care. When I want to see\nMrs. Wilkins I call on her whether she owes me a call or not, but with\nPolly Dawkins it's different. She began the book-keeping, and as long as\nshe likes it I must try to live up to her ideas. If social intercourse\ndevelops into a business, business requirements must be observed.\"\n\n\"It's a good idea in a way,\" said the Idiot, reflectively. \"But if you\nmake a business of society, why don't you carry it to a logical\nconclusion? Balance your books, if you mean business, every month, and\nsend your debtors a statement of their account.\"\n\n\"Well, I will if you wish me to,\" said Mrs. Idiot. \"Suppose they don't\npay?\"\n\n\"Dun 'em,\" said the Idiot. And then the matter dropped. On the fifth of the following month Mr. and Mrs. Idiot were seated\ncomfortably in their library. The children had gone to bed, and they\nwere enjoying the bliss of a quiet evening at home, when the door-bell\nrang, and in a moment or two the maid ushered in Mr. and Mrs. Richard\nDawkins, preceded, of course, by their cards. The young householders\nwere delighted, and Polly Dawkins was never more charming. She looked\nwell, and she talked well, and there was not a symptom of any diminution\nof the old-time friendship perceptible--only she did appear to be tired\nand care-worn. The evening wore away pleasantly. The chat reverted to old times, and by\ndegrees Mrs. Dawkins seemed to grow less tired. About ten o'clock the Idiot invited his neighbor to adjourn to the\nsmoking-room, where they each lit a cigar and indulged in a\ncompanionable glass. \"Idiot,\" said Dawkins, when his wife called out to him that it was time\nto go home, \"your wife is a wonder.",

    "text": "X\n\nAS TO SANTA CLAUS\n\n\"I am very glad I didn't take Tommy and Mollie to church with me this\nmorning,\" said Mrs. Idiot, on her return from service. \"It would have\nbroken their hearts to have heard the sermon. I don't know what gets\ninto Dr. Preachly sometimes. He gave us a blast about Santa Claus.\"\n\n\"A blast about Santa Claus, eh!\" said the Idiot. \"And how did he blast\nthe good old saint?\"\n\n\"He said he was a lie,\" rejoined Mrs. Idiot, indignantly, \"and that it\nwas the duty of every Christian in the land to see that the lie was\nexposed.\"\n\n\"Great heavens!\" cried the Idiot, in astonishment. \"Doesn't Dr. Preachly\nbelieve in Santa Claus? Poor old Preachly! How much he has lost! Did he\nsay anything about Hop o' My Thumb and Cinderella?\"\n\n\"No, of course not. Why should he?\" returned Mrs. Idiot. \"Oh, because; I suppose that a man who doesn't believe in Santa Claus is\na skeptic on the subject of Hop o' My Thumb, and Rumpelstiltzken, and\nCinderella, and Jack the Giant-Killer, and all the rest of that noble\narmy of childhood friends,\" explained the Idiot. \"He didn't mention them,\" said Mrs. Idiot. \"He--\"\n\n\"He's going to preach a series of sermons on lies, I presume,\" said the\nIdiot. \"He's tackled Santa Claus first, as being the most seasonable of\nthe lot, eh? Jack the Giant-Killer ought to be a good subject for a\nministerial attack.\"\n\n\"Well, he pulled poor old Santa Claus to pieces,\" said Mrs. Idiot, with\na sigh. \"Why didn't you bring me a piece of him as a souvenir?\" demanded the\nIdiot. \"Just a lock of his hair for my collection of curios? What was\ndone with the remains?\"\n\nMrs. Idiot laughed as she pulled over her gloves and smoothed them upon\nher lap. \"There weren't any remains,\" she answered. \"When Dr. Preachly got\nthrough with him there wasn't a vestige of the old chap left. To begin\nwith, he was a lie, the doctor said. Then he went on and showed that he\nwas a wickedly partial old fellow--a very snob, he called him--because\nhe gives fine things to the children of the rich and little or nothing\nto the children of the poor. He filled the little folk with hope and\nbrought them disappointment, and so on. It was a powerful sermon,\nalthough I wanted to weep over it.\"\n\n\"Go ahead and weep,\" said the Idiot; \"it's the appropriate thing to do. I don't wonder you wanted to cry; you've always liked Dr. Preachly.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said Mrs. Idiot. \"And you hate to see him make a--ah--a--well, you know--of himself in\nthe pulpit; and I quite agree with you. I rather like Preachly myself. It is too bad to see a well-meaning man like that batting his brains out\nagainst the rock of Gibraltar, whether suicide is sin or not. What has\nput him in this despondent mood? Do you suppose he has heard?\"\n\n\"Heard what?\" demanded Mrs. Idiot. \"About the slippers,\" said the Idiot. \"What slippers?\" asked his wife. \"Oh, the same old slippers,\" said the Idiot. \"You know the ones I\nmean--the ones he's going to get from Santa Claus. Really, I'm not\nsurprised, after all. If I were a minister, and realized that truckloads\nof embroidered slippers of every size and color, covered with stags of\nred worsted jumping over rivulets of yellow floss, with split agates for\neyes set in over the toe, were to be dumped in my front yard every\nChristmas Eve by that old reprobate, Santa Claus, I think I, too, would\nset him down as a fraud, or an overworked cobbler, anyhow.\"\n\n\n\n\"That's exaggerated--a comic-paper idea,\" said Mrs. Idiot. \"I don't\nbelieve the average clergyman gets so many slippers. Dr. Preachly only\ngot eight pairs last Christmas.\"\n\n\"Is that all?\" cried the Idiot. \"Mercy, what a small income of slippers! Dear me! how can he live with only eight pairs of slippers? But, after\nall, slippers are an appropriate gift for a clergyman,\" he added, \"and\nSanta Claus should be credited with that fact. Slippers have soles, and\nthe more slippers he gets the easier it is to save their soles, and\ntherefore--\"\n\n\"Really, my dear, you are flippant,\" said Mrs. Idiot. \"Not at all,\" rejoined the Idiot. \"I am merely trying to sit on two\nstools at once--to retain my respect for Dr. Preachly without giving up\nmy everlasting regard for Santa Claus. If I can't do both I am very much\nafraid it will be Dr. Preachly, and not Santa Claus, who will go to the\nwall in this establishment, and that would be sad. I can't say I think\nmuch of the doctor's logic. Do you?\"\n\n\"I didn't notice his logic,\" Mrs. Idiot replied. \"Very likely,\" said the Idiot; \"from what you tell me of his discourse I\nimagine he must have left it at home, which is a bad thing to do in an\nargument. To begin, he called Santa a lie, did he?\"\n\n\"Yes; said he didn't exist at all.\"\n\n\"Good! Then how could he have been a snob?\"\n\n\"Why, while of course I have no sympathy with his conclusions, Dr. Preachly handled that point pretty well. It certainly is true that in\nthe homes of the rich there is a lavishness of gifts that you don't\nfind in the homes of the poor, and therefore Santa Claus treats the rich\nbetter than he does the poor. We all know that.\"\n\n\"Hum!\" said the Idiot. \"And so it is Santa Claus who is the snob, eh,\nand not Fortune?\"\n\n\"Well, Dr. Preachly did not touch upon that. All he said was that Santa\nClaus was a snob for favoring 'high society' and in many cases\nabsolutely ignoring the submerged.\"\n\n\"But I don't see how,\" said the Idiot. \"Suppose he brings a diamond necklace to the daughter of a Croesus?\"\n\n\"Precisely,\" said the Idiot.",

The china doll is\nnot only more appropriate, but a better plaything.\"\n\n\"Well, anyhow, he gives richly to those that have, and sparsely, if at\nall, to those that haven't, Dr. Preachly said,\" said Mrs. Idiot. \"There is scriptural authority for that,\" observed the Idiot. \"I wonder\nif Dr. Preachly reads his Bible! Perhaps I'd better send him one for\nChristmas instead of a pair of galoshes. He'll find in the Bible that\n'to him that hath shall be given,' and so forth. But to return to the\nlogic--\"\n\n\"I told you I didn't notice it,\" said Mrs. Idiot. \"Nor did Dr. Preachly, my dear; passed it by as if it were a poor\nrelation, apparently. But this is true, a lie is an untruth. Truth alone\nlives, therefore an untruth does not live. Santa Claus is a lie and does\nnot live, and is a snob, according to our reverend logician. Now, how\ncan one who does not live be a snob or anything else? Truly, I wish Dr. Preachly would be more careful in his statements. As a pew-holder in his\nchurch I do not like to hear him denounce something that does not exist\nas having unworthy qualities. It's like shaking a sword at nothing and\npatting yourself on the back afterwards for your courage; still more in\nthis instance is it like batting your poor mortal head against the hard\nsurface of an everlasting rock, and our clergy should be in better\nbusiness. \"Let 'em fight the harmful lies--the lies of false social ideas as\npropagated by distinctions of pew-holding, for instance. The man who\nsits in the front of the church is no better than the man who sits at\nthe back, and is frequently his inferior; but has he more or has he less\ninfluence? The man who hands in his check for ten thousand dollars,\nhaving that and more to spare, is not more the friend of religion and\nChristianity than the poor beggar who stumbles in and puts his penny in\nthe plate, thus diminishing by one-fifth his capital. Suppose Santa\nClaus is in a material sense a fancy or a lie; Heaven help Dr. Preachly\nif he can't see the beauty and the ethical value of the deception. Is he\nnot the embodiment of the golden rule, and is he not, after all--God\nbless him and them!--something beautiful in the eyes of the children?\"\n\n\"I'm flippant, and I know it, but there are some things I cling to,\" he\nadded, after a pause. \"Santa Claus is one of them, and Dr. Preachly can\npreach through all eternity, and, with all due respect to him, he can't\nremove from my mind the beauty of an idea that was planted there by two\npeople who were practical enough, my father and my mother. I've\ninherited Santa Claus, and I'm not going to give him up, and no\npreacher in our church or in the church of others can take him away from\nme by one sermon, or by an infinite number of sermons, however sincere\nthey may be. Is dinner ready?\"\n\nDinner was ready. It was eaten reflectively, and after it the children\nwent to Sunday-school. From this Tommy returned with a swollen eye,\nwhich later became dark. \"Hullo, pop!\" he said, addressing the Idiot as he entered the house. \"Hullo, sonny!\" replied the Idiot, observing the swollen eye. \"Had a\ngood time?\"\n\n\"Yep,\" said the boy; \"pretty good.\"\n\n\"Been fighting?\" suggested the Idiot. \"Not so very much,\" said the boy; \"only a little.\" And he began to sing\na popular air, as if he didn't care much about life in general, and\ndidn't mind an aching eye, which was rapidly, by its inflammation,\ngiving away the fact that he had met with trouble. \"What did you learn at Sunday-school?\" asked the Idiot. \"More blessed to give than to receive,\" said Tommy. \"Good!\" said the Idiot. \"I hope you will remember that, sonny. There is\nno satisfaction in all the world like that of giving if you can afford\nit.\"\n\n\n\n\"I think tho, too,\" said Mollie, sitting down on her father's lap with\nthe contented sigh of a little girl who has discovered that life is not\nall an illusion. \"I gave my dollie away to-day, papa,\" she added. \"She\nwath only thawdust, and Pollie Harrington hath her now. She was a\ndrefful care, and I'm glad to be ridden of her.\"\n\nBut the Idiot's mind was not on dolls, and he showed it. His boy's eye\nproved a greater care. \"Come here, my boy,\" he said.

Later on Mrs. Idiot and the Idiot sat together. The latter was deep in\nthought. \"Children have queer notions,\" said he, after a while. \"They are generally pretty right, though,\" observed Mrs. Idiot. \"You are\na pretty good Santa Claus, after all,\" she added. \"Pollie,\" said the Idiot, rising, \"I believe in Santa Claus because he\nrepresents the spirit of the hour, and whoever tries to turn him down\ntries to turn down that spirit--the most blessed thing we have. Let's\nkeep the children believing in Santa Claus, eh?\"\n\n\"I agree,\" said Mrs. Idiot. \"For the secret is out. You are Santa Claus\nto them.\"\n\n\"Heaven grant I may always be as much,\" said the Idiot. \"For if a father\nis Santa Claus, and a boy or a girl believes in Santa Claus as a friend,\nas a companion, as something that brings them only sincerity and love\nand sympathy, then may we feel that Tiny Tim's prayer has been answered,\nand that God has blessed us all.\"",

    "text": "XI\n\nAS TO NEW-YEAR'S DAY\n\nIt was New-Year's eve, and Mr. and Mrs. Idiot with their old friends\nwere watching the old year die. The old year had been a fairly\nsuccessful one for them all, and they were properly mournful over its\nprospective demise, but the promise of the new was sufficiently bright\nto mitigate their sorrow. \"What a sandwich life is, after all!\" ejaculated the Idiot. Mr. Pedagog started nervously. The remark was so idiotic that even its\nsource seemed to make it inexcusable. \"I don't quite catch your drift,\" said he. \"As the man said when an avalanche of snow fell off his neighbor's roof\nand missed him by an inch,\" said the Idiot. \"Why, just think a moment,\nDoctor, and my drift will overwhelm you. Look about you and consider\nwhat we have ourselves demonstrated to-night. If that does not prove\nlife a series of emotional sandwiches, then I don't know what a sandwich\nis. Twenty minutes ago we were all gladness over the prosperity of the\nyear gone by. Five minutes ago we were all on the verge of tears because\nthe good old year is going the way of all years. An hour from now we\nwill be joyously acclaiming the new. Two thick slices of joy with a thin\nslice of grief between.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Mr. Pedagog. \"I see. There is something in the analogy, after\nall. The bread of joy and the ham of sorrow, as you might put it; do\nmake up the sum of human existence; but in some cases, my lad, I am\nafraid you will find there is only one slice of bread to two of ham.\"\n\n\"No doubt,\" replied the Idiot, \"but that does not affect my proposition\nthat life is a sandwich. If one slice of ham between two slices of bread\nis a ham sandwich, why is not one slice of bread between two slices of\nham a bread sandwich? What is a sandwich, anyhow? The dictionary says\nthat a sandwich is something placed between two other things; hence,\nall things are sandwiches, because there is nothing in the world, the\nworld being round, that is not between two other things. Therefore, all\nthings being sandwiches, life is a sandwich, Q. E. D.\"\n\n\"Is life a thing?\" demanded Mr. Pedagog. \"Certainly,\" said the Idiot. \"And a mighty good thing, too. If you don't\nbelieve it look the word thing up in the dictionary. All things are\nthings.\"\n\n\"But,\" continued the Schoolmaster, his old spirit of antagonism rising\nup in his breast, \"granted that life is a thing, what is it between so\nthat it becomes a sandwich?\"\n\n\"The past and the future,\" said the Idiot. \"It is a slice of the\nimmediate between a slice of past and one of future.\"\n\nMr. Pedagog laughed. \"You are still the same old Idiot,\" he said. \"Yes,\" said the Idiot. \"Gibraltar and I and Truth are the three\nunchangeable things in this life, and that's why I am so happy. I'm in\nsuch good company. Gibraltar and Truth are good enough companions for\nanybody.\"\n\nMeanwhile Mollie and Tommy, who had been allowed to sit up upon this\nrare occasion, stirred uneasily. \"Ith I a thandwich, popper?\" said the little girl, sleepily, raising her\nhead from her father's shoulder and gazing into his eyes. \"Yes, indeed, you are,\" said her father, giving her an affectionate\nsqueeze. \"A sugar sandwich, Mollie. You're really good enough to eat.\"\n\n\"Well, I'd rather be a pie,\" put in Tommy; \"an apple pie.\"\n\n\"Very well, my son,\" returned the Idiot. \"Have your own way. Henceforth\nbe a pie if you prefer--an apple pie. But may I ask why you express this\npreference?\"\n\n\"Oh, because,\" said Tommy, \"if I'm to be an apple pie somebody's got to\nfill me chock-full of apple sauce.\"\n\n\"The son of his father,\" observed Mr. Whitechoker. \"I think it is a pity,\" Mrs. Pedagog put in at this point, \"that some of\nthe good old customs of the New Year have gone out.\"\n\n\"As to which, Mrs. Pedagog?\" asked the Idiot. \"Well, New-Year's calling particularly,\" explained the lady. \"It is no\nlonger the thing for people to make New-Year's calls, and I must confess\nI regret it. It used to be a great pleasure to me in the old days to\nreceive the gentlemen--my old friends, and relatives, and boarders.\"\n\n\"Why distinguish between your old friends and your boarders, Mrs. Pedagog?\" interrupted the Idiot. \"They are synonymous terms.\"\n\n\"They are now,\" said the good lady, \"but--ah--they weren't always. I\nused sometimes to think you, for instance, didn't like me as much as you\nmight.\"\n\n\"I didn't dare,\" explained the Idiot. \"If I'd liked you as much as I\nmight I'd have told you so, and then Mr. Pedagog would have got jealous\nand there'd have been a horrid affair.\"\n\nThe lady smiled graciously, and Mr. Pedagog threw a small paper pellet\nat the Idiot. \"I'm much obliged to you for holding off, Idiot,\" he said. \"I don't know\nwhere I'd have been to-day if you'd got in ahead of me. Mrs. Pedagog has\nalways had a soft spot in her heart for you.\"\n\n\"I've got the other spot,\" said the Idiot, \"and a pair of aces are hard\nto beat in pairs; but I think I voice Mrs. Pedagog's sentiments in the\nmatter, Mr. Pedagog, when I say that she and I would always have been\nglad to see you every other New-Year's day if I had been the fortunate\nwinner of her hand.\"\n\n\"And Mr. Pedagog and I would have been glad to see you and Mrs. Pedagog\nin the sandwich years,\" said Mrs. Idiot to her husband; and then,\nturning to the Schoolmaster, added, \"Wouldn't we, Mr. Pedagog?\"\n\n\"No, madame,\" returned Mr. Pedagog, courteously. \"You might have been,\nbut I would not. If I had married you I could never have seen any one\nelse with pleasure.",

If I had married you I could never have seen any one\nelse with pleasure. I should have kept my eyes solely for you.\"\n\n\"John!\" cried Mrs. Pedagog, arching her eyebrows. \"Pleasantry, my dear--mere pleasantry,\" returned the Schoolmaster,\ntapping his fingers together and smiling sweetly upon Mrs. Idiot. \"You didn't finish, Mrs. Pedagog,\" said the Idiot. \"You were telling us\nhow you used to enjoy New-Year's calling before it went out.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Mrs. Pedagog. \"It was charming. I used positively to\nlook forward to its coming with delight. We women, Mr. Idiot, found the\nold custom very delightful.\"\n\n\"But the men, Mrs. Pedagog,\" said the Idiot, \"did you ever think of\nthem?\"\n\n\"What else did we think of? What else is there for a woman to think\nabout?\" replied Mrs. Pedagog. \"Jane!\" cried Mr. Pedagog. \"_Pleasantry, my dear--mere pleasantry_,\" returned Mrs. Pedagog,\nfrigidly. And Mr. Pedagog lit a cigar. It is not always pleasant to be\nquoted. \"Still,\" said the Idiot, \"you thought of men only as creatures of the\nmoment--\"\n\n\"Entirely,\" said Mrs. Pedagog. \"And not as creatures of the week following,\" said the Idiot. \"What has that to do with it?\" asked Mrs. Pedagog. \"Much--from the man's stand-point,\" returned the Idiot. \"His digestion\nwas butchered to make a woman's holiday. Take myself as an example. I\nused to make New-Year's calls; and to get through with my list by\nmidnight, I had to start in at nine o'clock in the morning.\"\n\n\"Nine o'clock is not so early,\" said Mr. Whitechoker. \"It's early for cake and pickled oysters,\" said the Idiot. \"And for\nchicken salad and wedding-cake, and for lemonade and punch, and for\nlobster and egg-nog, and for ice-cream and _p\u00e2t\u00e9-de-foie-gras_.\"\n\n\"H'm!\" said Mr. Pedagog, reflectively. \"That's true.\"\n\n\"Quite so,\" observed Mr. Whitechoker, brushing off his vest, upon which\nthe ashes of his cigar had rested. \"Especially for the punch.\"\n\n\"There was no punch in my house,\" said Mrs. Pedagog. \"Indeed, I always\nserved a very simple luncheon. We did have chicken salad, of course, but\nthe chicken was good and the salad was crisp--\"\n\n\"I'd swear to it,\" said the Idiot. \"And we had egg-nog, but there was more egg than nog in it--\"\n\n\"Again I'd swear to it,\" said the Idiot, smacking his lips. \"And as for the lobsters, nobody ever complained--\"\n\n\"He'd have been a lobster himself who would,\" said the Idiot. \"But that\ndoes not prove that no one ever suffered.\"\n\n\"And as for the pickled oysters, no one ever suffered from them that I\nknew of,\" continued the good lady. \"They are harmless eaten in\nmoderation.\"\n\n\n\n\"Exactly right,\" cried the Idiot. \"No gentleman would ever complain of\npickled oysters, even if they were made of inferior rubber, eaten in\nmoderation. Yet I recall in my own experience a pickled oyster of most\nimpressive quality. He was not a pickled oyster of the moment. He was\nthe Admiral Dewey of pickled oysters. In appearance he resembled every\nother pickled oyster I ever met, but--well, he kept me in a state of\nworry for a month. Just eating him alone was eating pickled oysters in\nimmoderation. I felt as if I had swallowed an overshoe. He was a\ncharming pickled oyster, Mrs. Pedagog, and he was devoted to me, but he\ninvolved me in complications alongside of which the Philippine question\nis child's play. If a New-Year's caller could have confined his\nattentions to the ladies he met no harm would have come to him, but he\ncouldn't, you know. The day was one continuous round of effort and\nindigestibles. What a man got at your house and had to eat merely to\nshow his appreciation of your hospitality was all right and wholesome. Your lobster and egg-nog could do him no harm, but he couldn't stop with\nyours; he had to continue, and consume lobsters and egg-nog everywhere\nelse and all day long. The day resolved itself into a magnificent gorge\nalongside of which that of Niagara seems like a wagon-rut. It finally\ncame down to the point where either man or the custom had to die, and\nman being selfish, the custom went. Did you ever consider exactly how\nmuch indigestible food an amiable, well-meaning person had to consume in\na round of, say, three dozen calls, Mrs. Pedagog?\"\n\nMr. Brief nodded his approval. \"Now you've struck it,\" he said. \"I've\nbeen there, Idiot.\"\n\n\"I must confess,\" said Mrs. Pedagog, \"that I never looked into that\nquestion.\"\n\n\"Well, I'll tell you,\" the Idiot resumed.",

The Idiot chuckled. \"What did he say?\" he cried. \"Why, I should think\nyou could guess. He blamed it all on the Welsh rarebits, but he thought\nhe could get me into shape again in time for the next New Year. I've\nnever been the same man since.\"\n\n\"Well, the way I look at it,\" said Mrs. Pedagog, \"is that it is a great\npity that women must be deprived of a function that gives them pleasure\nbecause the men make pigs of themselves.\"\n\n\"But you don't understand, Mrs. Pedagog,\" the Idiot persisted. \"I grant\nyou that the man who eats all that makes a pig of himself, but he has no\nchoice. He can't help himself. When a charming hostess insists, he'd be\na greater pig if he refused to partake of her hospitality. The custom\ninvolved an inevitable sacrifice of man's digestion upon the altar of\nwoman. That's all there was about it. If it could have been arranged so\nthat a man could take a hamper about with him and stow all the cakes and\nsalads and other good things away in that, and eat them later as he\nhappened to need or want them, instead of in his own inner self, the\ngood old custom might have been preserved, but that is impossible in\nthese conventional days.\"\n\n\"You needn't have eaten it all,\" put in Mrs. Idiot. \"You could have\npretended to eat it and put it down somewhere.\"\n\n[Illustration: \"'I FOUND EIGHT SANDWICHES AND A PINT OF SALTED\nALMONDS'\"]\n\n[Illustration: \"'THEY WERE FOUND SOME DAYS LATER WHEN THE ROOM WAS PUT\nIN ORDER'\"]\n\n\"I know that, my dear. I didn't even on that occasion eat it all--I only\nate what I told you. I found eight sandwiches and a pint of salted\nalmonds in my coat-tail pocket the next morning, which I managed\nsurreptitiously to hide away while my hostesses were getting me\nsomething else, and in one place, while nobody was watching me, I hid a\nhalf-dozen pickled oysters under a sofa, where I suppose they were found\nsome days later when the room was put in order.\"\n\nAs the Idiot spoke the clock struck twelve, and the guests all rose up. \"Here's to the New Year!\" said Mr. Pedagog. \"Not yet,\" interposed the Idiot. \"That's only a signal for the Welsh\nrarebits to be brought in. I've sworn them off for the New Year, but I\nhaven't for the old. The clock is a half-hour fast.\"\n\n\"No, my dear,\" said Mrs. Idiot. \"It was, but I put it back. It's exactly\nright now.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said the Idiot, \"I join you in the toast, Mr. Pedagog. Here's to\nthe New Year: may it bring joy to everybody. Meanwhile may it bring also\nthe Welsh rarebits.\"\n\n\"I thought you'd sworn off,\" suggested Mr. Pedagog. \"So I had,\" replied the Idiot, \"but circumstances over which I have no\ncontrol force me to postpone my reformation for another twelve months. If they had been served at half-past eleven I should have stuck to my\nresolve; as they have been delayed until twelve-one I cannot do less\nthan eat them. I do not believe in wilful waste; and besides, it is\nquite as much the duty of the host to consume the good things he places\nbefore his guests as it is for the guests to partake.",

These two important members of the household went\nup to their little beds, but just before going to sleep Tommy called\nthrough the door to his little sister:\n\n\"Mollie!\"\n\n\"Yeth!\"\n\n\"Want to play a game with me to-morrow?\"\n\n\"Yeth!\"\n\n\"Well, you get a cake and a pie and some gingersnaps and a lot of apples\nand some candy and we'll play New-Year's calls.\"\n\n\"Splendid!\" lisped Mollie. \"You'll call on me?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Tommy; \"and all you'll have to do will be to force food on\nme.\"\n\nAnd they soon passed into the land of dreams.",

    "text": "XII\n\nSOME DOMESTIC INVENTIONS\n\n\n\n\"I think I'll give up the business of broking and go into inventing,\"\nsaid the Idiot one Sunday morning, as he and Mrs. Idiot and their\nfriends sat down at breakfast. \"There's not much money in stocks, but\nthe successful inventor of a patent clothes-pin makes a fortune.\"\n\n\"I'd think twice about that before acting,\" observed Mr. Brief. \"There\nmay not be much money in stocks, but you can work eight hours a day, and\nget good pay in a broker's office, while the inventor has to wait upon\ninspiration.\"\n\n\"True enough,\" said the Idiot; \"but waiting on inspiration isn't a bad\nbusiness in itself. You can play golf or read a rattling good novel, or\ngo to a yacht-race while you wait.\"\n\n\"But where does the money come in?\" asked Mr. Pedagog, his usual\ncaution coming to the fore. \"Inspiration brings it with her,\" said the Idiot, \"and by the barrel,\ntoo. What's the use of toiling eight hours a day for fifty weeks in a\nyear for three thousand dollars when by waiting on inspiration in a\npleasant way you make a million all of a sudden?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Mr. Pedagog, indulgently, \"if you have the inspiration\nlassoed, as you might say, your argument is all right; but if you are\nmerely going to sit down and wait for it to ring you up on the\ntelephone, and ask you when and where you wish your barrels of gold\ndelivered, I think it will be your creditors, and not fortune, who will\nbe found knocking at your door. How are you going about this business,\nprovided you do retire from Wall Street?\"\n\n\"Choose my field and work it,\" replied the Idiot. \"For the present I\nshould choose the home. That is the field I am most interested in just\nnow. I should study its necessities, and endeavor to meet whatever these\nmight demand with an adequate supply. Any man who stays around home all\nday will find lots of room for the employment of his talents along\ninventive lines.\"\n\n\"You've tried it, have you?\" asked Mr. Brief. \"Certainly I have,\" said the Idiot, \"though I haven't invented anything\nyet. Why, only last week I stayed home on Monday--wash-day--and a\nthousand things that might be invented suggested themselves to me.\"\n\n\"As, for instance?\" asked Mrs. Idiot, who was anxious to know of any\npossible thing that could mitigate the horrors of wash-day. [Illustration: \"'A NICE LITTLE BASKET-HAT ON HER HEAD TO HOLD THE PINS\nIN'\"]\n\n\"Well, it wouldn't help _you_ much, my dear,\" said the Idiot, \"but the\nwash-lady would hail with unmixed delight a substitute for her mouth to\nhold clothes-pins in while she is hanging out the clothes. I watched\nEllen in the yard for ten minutes that day, and it was pathetic. There\nshe was, standing on her tiptoes, hanging innumerable garments on the\nline, her mouth full of clothes-pins, and Jimpsonberry's hired man\nleaning over the fence trying to shout sweet nothings in her ear. If she\nhad had a nice little basket-hat on her head to hold the pins in she\ncould have answered back without stopping her work every other minute\nto take them out of her mouth in order to retort to his honeyed\nsentiments.\"\n\nMrs. Idiot laughed. \"Ellen finds time enough to talk and do the washing,\ntoo,\" she said. \"I sometimes think she does more talking than washing.\"\n\n\"No doubt of it; she's only human, like the rest of us,\" said the Idiot. \"But she might save time to do something else for us if she could do the\nwashing and the talking at the same time. She may give up the washing,\nbut she'll never give up the talking. Therefore, why not make the\ntalking easier?\"\n\n\"What you need most, I think,\" put in Mr. Brief, \"is an instrument to\nkeep hired men from leaning over the fence and distracting the attention\nof the laundress from her work. That would be a great boon.\"\n\n\"Not unless idleness is a great boon,\" retorted the Idiot. \"Half the\nhired men I know would be utterly out of employment if they couldn't\nlean over a fence and talk to somebody. Leaning over a fence and talking\nto somebody forms seventy-five per cent. of the hired man's daily labor. He seems to think that is what he is paid for. Still, any one who\nobjects could very easily remedy the conversational detail in so far as\nit goes on over the fence.\"\n\n\"By the use of barbed wire, I presume,\" suggested Mr. Pedagog. \"By something far more subtle and delicately suggestive,\" rejoined the\nIdiot. \"Hired men do not mind barbed-wire fences. They rather like them\nwhen they annoy other people. When they annoy themselves they know how\nto treat them. My own man Mike, for instance, minds them not at all. Indeed, he has taken my pruning-shears and clipped all the barbs off the\nsmall stretch of it we had at the rear end of our lot to keep him from\nclimbing over for a short cut home.\"\n\n\"With what result?\" asked Mr. Brief. \"With the result that I had to buy a new pair of pruning-shears,\" said\nthe Idiot. \"My Anti-Over-the-Fence-Gabber,\" he continued, \"would involve\ncertain complex details, but it would work. I should have an electric\nbattery connected with the upper cable of the fence, and an operator\nstationed inside of the house, close to a key which would send some\nsix hundred or seven hundred volts through the cable whenever needed. Then if I felt that Jimpsonberry's man was interfering with my\nlaundress, as soon as he leaned over the fence I'd have the operator\nsend him an electric notice to quit.\"\n\n\"A message?\" said Mr. Pedagog. \"No, a plain shock. Two hundred volts as a starter, three hundred as a\nreminder, and the full seven hundred if necessary to make the hint\nplainer.\"\n\n\"That would be cruel,\" observed Mrs. Pedagog. \"Not wholly,\" said the Idiot.",

I compel Mike to weed out my lawn every spring and autumn,\nbut Jimpsonberry doesn't attend to his at all. He doesn't sleep on it,\nand so doesn't bother about it. Consequently, when his dandelions go to\nseed the seed is blown over into my grass, and every year I get an\nuninvited crop, which at a dollar a thousand would make me a\nmillionaire.\"\n\n\"Why don't you apply your inventive genius to the discovery of a\nseedless dandelion?\" asked the Lawyer. \"It seems to me that would be the\nbest solution of the dandelion problem.\"\n\n\"Because Jimpsonberry wouldn't have 'em if I discovered 'em,\" said the\nIdiot. \"I judge from the millions he raises every year that he is\nsatisfied with dandelions as they are. He's got enough for himself, and\nnever makes any charge for those he gives to his neighbors.\"\n\n\"I think a furnace-feeder would be a good thing, too,\" the Idiot\ncontinued, in a moment. \"My furnace is a chronic sufferer from\nindigestion because on some days it is gorged with coal and on others\nwith ashes. Seems to me if I could get a month's time in which to\nconcentrate my attention upon a furnace-feeder, I could devise some kind\nof a contraption that would invoke the enthusiastic love of the suburban\nresident in Arctic latitudes the world over.\"\n\n\"I have often thought of that possibility myself,\" observed Mr. Pedagog,\nhis eyes fondly resting upon a steaming plate of griddle-cakes that\nhad just been brought in. \"But coal is a rebellious quantity. A\nfurnace-feeder would need to be delicately adjusted, and coal cannot be\nhandled with delicacy. It requires a chute rather than a tube. It must\nbe manipulated with the shovel, not the sugar-tongs.\"\n\n\"Correct,\" said the Idiot. \"Therefore, _you_ would experiment on a chute\nor a shovel, abandoning all idea of refining the coal. I, on the other\nhand, would experiment with the coal itself, Mr. Pedagog. Why not\nliquefy it, and let it drop automatically into the furnace through a\nself-acting spigot?\"\n\n\"Liquefy coal?\" asked Mr. Pedagog. \"Certainly,\" replied the Idiot. \"We liquefy pretty nearly everything\nelse. If liquid air, why not liquid coal? Everything we have in nature\nin these days apparently can be liquefied, and while I am not familiar\nwith the process, I see no reason why a ton of coal should not be\nreduced to such a shape that it can be bottled. Once bottled and\nprovided with an automatic dropper, it could easily be adjusted so as to\nflow in proper quantities into the furnace at proper intervals.\"\n\n\"It would be very expensive. Do you know what a pint of liquid air\ncosts?\" demanded the Doctor. \"No,\" said the Idiot. \"I neither breathe nor drink it. The plain old\nstuff is good enough for me, and cheap if you don't have to go to the\nmountains or the sea-shore to get your supply.\"\n\n\"Granting coal could be liquefied,\" the Doctor assented, \"I venture to\nsay that a ton of it would cost as much as five hundred dollars.\"\n\n\"I've no doubt it would,\" said the Idiot; \"but I could afford a ton of\ncoal at five hundred dollars if my scheme worked. A successful invention\nwould make bread seem cheap at ten dollars a loaf. There's another thing\nI should put my mind on, and that is a method of cooking a cauliflower\nso that everybody in the house, as well as the neighbors, should not\nknow that you are doing so,\" he continued. \"I am particularly fond of\ncauliflower, but it is undeniable that in the process of cooking it\nbecomes obtrusive, almost to the point of ostentation. I've spoken about\nit many times. Mike, the gardener, to whom I've spoken on the subject,\nthinks the cauliflower itself, if sprinkled with _eau de Cologne_ while\ngrowing, would cease to be obnoxious in the cooking; but that is too\nexpensive a process. It would take a dozen cases of _eau de Cologne_ to\nbring a single cauliflower to maturity. My son, Tommy, has stated that\nhe thinks it might be boiled in Florida-water instead of in the simple\nvariety that comes from the pipes. A good suggestion for a small boy,\nbut also expensive.

But as far as the arrangement of an odorless\ncauliflower-cooker is concerned, it is as simple as A B C, barring one\nor two complications.\"\n\n\"I wish you'd hurry up and invent it,\" cried Mrs. Idiot, with\nenthusiasm. \"What are the main features of this simple contrivance?\"\n\n\"I'd have a boiler, in the first place, in which to boil the animal,\"\nsaid the Idiot. \"When the water was ready I'd clap the creature into it,\nand before it had time to remonstrate I'd fasten a hermetically sealed\ncover over the top.\"\n\n\"But when you took it off the results would still be overpowering,\" said\nMr. Pedagog. \"No, my dear sir,\" said the Idiot, \"for the simple reason that I should\naffix a cold-air box and a flue to the hermetically sealed boiler. Through the cold-air box fresh air would constantly flow into the\nboiler. Through the flue all the aromatic drawbacks of the cauliflower\nwould be carried off through the chimney into the upper air. Anybody who\nwished to know whether we were going to have cauliflower for dinner or\nnot would have to climb up to the roof and sniff at the chimney-top to\nfind out.\"\n\n\"It _is_ simple, isn't it, Mrs. Idiot?\" Mrs. Pedagog said. \"Very,\" replied Mrs. Idiot. \"Indeed, it seems so extremely simple that I\nshould like to know where the complications lie.\"\n\n\"Where all the complications in cooking lie, my dear,\" said the\nIdiot, \"in the cook. The chief complication would lie in getting a cook\nwho could, or if she could, would, use the thing intelligently.\"\n\n\"I don't see,\" said Mr. Brief, dryly--\"I don't see but that what you\nought to devote your time to, my dear Idiot, is the invention of an\nintelligent cook.\"\n\n\"Humph!\" laughed the Idiot. \"I may be an idiot, Mr. Brief, but I'm not\nan ass. There are some things that man may reasonably hope to\naccomplish--such as setting fire to the Hudson River, or growing\nbutternuts on the summit of Mont Blanc--but as for trying to invent an\nintelligent cook who would stay in the country for more than two weeks\nfor less than ten thousand dollars a year, that, sir, is beyond all the\nconceptions of the human mind.\"\n\n\"Ain't Bridget intelligent, pa?\" asked Tommy. Here was a complication, for Tommy liked to retail to Bridget the gossip\nof the day, and especially what \"pa said.\"\n\n\"H'm--ah--oh yes, indeed, she is, Tommy,\" the Idiot replied, with some\nembarrassment. \"Very; she's been with us three months.\"\n\n\"How much do you pay her, pa?\" asked the boy. \"Well,\" said the Idiot, \"not more than fifteen hundred dollars a month. Just take another griddle-cake, my son, and remember that there are some\nthings little boys should not talk about.\"\n\n\"Like tumpany's bald heads?\" lisped Mollie, complacently, her eye fixed\nupon Mr. Pedagog's shining dome. \"Precisely,\" observed Mr. Pedagog, appreciating the situation. And while everybody else laughed the Idiot looked upon his children with\na sternly affectionate face. \"My dear,\" said he to Mrs. Idiot, \"I think it is time the babies got\nready for Sunday-school.\"",

    "text": "XIII\n\nA SUBURBAN COMPLICATION\n\n\"Well, old chap,\" said the Poet some weeks later, when he happened to be\nspending the night off in the suburbs with his old friend, \"how goes the\nnoble art of inventing? Has your horseless cauliflower bloomed as yet?\"\n\n\"Horseless cauliflower is good, but tautological,\" said the Idiot. \"The\ncauliflower is an automobile in itself, without the intervention of man. Who told you I was inventing instead of broking these days?\"\n\n\"Mr. Pedagog said something about it the last time I met him,\" said the\nPoet. \"He's a mighty good friend of yours. He says you are the most\nperfect Idiot he ever met.\"\n\n\"He's a bully good fellow,\" said the Idiot, affectionately. \"You know I\nused to think Pedagog wasn't of any earthly use except to teach people\nthings, but as I look back upon my experience with him he has never\ntaught me anything that was worth forgetting. So he told you I was going\ninto invention, did he?\"\n\n\"Yes; and he said he thought you were going about it in the right way,\"\nrejoined the Poet. \"You weren't spending ten thousand dollars to get a\nfour-dollar invention on the market, he said, but were inventing things\nthat you knew at the outset weren't worth risking your money on.\"\n\nThe Idiot smiled broadly. \"He said that, did he? Well, he doesn't know what he is talking about,\"\nhe retorted. \"I am spending money on my inventions. I have already\ninvested fifty cents in my patent Clothes-Pin-Holding Laundry-Bonnet,\nand I have strung the wires along my fence to be used in my electric\nHired-Man-Discourager; and when I have managed to save up a few dollars\nmore I'm going to get a battery to attach to it, when woe betide that\nman of Jimpsonberry's if he tries to talk to Maria while she is at work! Furthermore, I have extended the operations of that same useful\ninvention so that it will meet a long-felt want in all suburban\ncommunities as a discourager of promiscuous wooing. You never lived\nin the country, did you?\"\n\n\"Not permanently,\" said the Poet. [Illustration: \"'COURTING HIS BEST GIRL ON SOME OTHER FELLOW'S STONE\nWALL'\"]\n\n\"Then you are not aware of a singular habit the young country swain has\nof courting his best girl on some other fellow's stone wall after the\nsun goes down,\" said the Idiot. \"Some balmy evening next spring, if\nyou'll come up here I'll show you one of the features of suburban life\nthat will give you an idea for a poem. That stone wall that runs along\nthe front of my place has been the scene of more engagements than I can\ntell you of. Many a time when I have come home late at night I have\ncounted as many as ten couples sitting on the cold coping of that wall\ntelling each other how beautiful the world is, and holding each other on\nwith loving arms.\"\n\n\"Rather an affecting scene, that,\" said the Poet. \"It was at first,\" rejoined the Idiot, \"and I rather liked to see it. Indeed, I once suggested to Mrs. Idiot that we should have the coping\nupholstered, so that they might sit more comfortably. I even wanted to\nput a back along the inner side of it for them to lean against, but\nafter a while it palled. We couldn't sit out on our own front porch on\na summer evening and talk without sentimental interruptions that were\ndemoralizing to a sustained conversation. We'd try to talk, for\ninstance, about Browning, or Tennyson, or Le Gallienne, or some other\npoet of their class, when we'd be interrupted by such sentiments as,\n'Ess I is,' and 'I's oo ducky,' and 'Ain't de moon boofer?' Then when we\nhad guests we never dared to take them out-of-doors, but remained cooped\nup inside the house, because Mrs. Idiot feared to intrude upon the\nsacred right of those ten couples to do their courting comparatively\nunobserved.\"\n\n\"It must have been a nuisance,\" said the Poet. \"It grew to be so; but I hadn't the heart to stop it, even if I could\nhave done so, so I put up a hedge to hide them from view and soften the\nsound of their voices; but it didn't work very long. They didn't seem to\nappreciate my motive, and it so happened that the hedge which I put up\nwith the most innocent of intentions was a Japanese quince that blossoms\nout in thorns half an inch long, to an extent which suggests the fretful\nporcupine. These, for some reason or other, excited the animosity of\nmy twenty young friends on the wall, and at the end of the season there\nwere not two consecutive feet of the hedge that had not been hacked and\ncut to pieces by my indignant but uninvited guests.\"\n\n\"What impudence!\" cried the Poet. \"Only the ardor of youth,\" observed the Idiot, calmly. \"Put yourself in\nthe same place. Suppose that you, just as you were about to declare your\nundying love for the girl of your choice, and while gently stealing your\narm about her waist, were to have the back of your hand ripped off by a\nbrutal hedge?\"\n\n\"I see,\" laughed the Poet. \"I dare say I should be indignant.\"\n\n\"They were properly so,\" said the Idiot, \"properly so; and neither Mrs. Idiot nor I really blamed them.\"\n\n\n\n\"We let the matter rest, and made no complaint,\" he continued. \"Time\nwent on, and the courters became a trifle more assertive. One of them\ncame into the house one evening and demanded to know what I meant by\nassaulting him and his lady friend, holding up a great Osage orange\nwhich he alleged to have been the murderous weapon I had used; and I\nreally had to apologize, for I was guilty.",

It happened that while\nwalking about my small preserves I had picked up this orange, which had\nfallen onto my lawn from a tree on Jimpsonberry's place, and had\nunthinkingly tried to see how far I could throw it. It went just over\nthe hedge, and had unceremoniously knocked Strephon's hat into the\nmiddle of next week and frightened Phyllis into hysterics. I was placed\non the defensive, but for the life of me I couldn't help laughing, with\nthe result that Strephon stalked angrily away, alleging that I should\nhear from him further in the matter.\"\n\n\"And did you?\" asked the Poet. \"No,\" said the Idiot, \"I never did; but the incident rather soured me\ntowards the people who seemed to regard my stone wall as their property. I even came to feel like purchasing a gatling-gun and loading it with\nOsage oranges for the purpose of repelling them, but even under this\nprovocation I still continued to ignore the matter.\"\n\n\"You are too easy-going,\" suggested the Poet. \"I was,\" said the Idiot, \"until they began to use the sidewalk that runs\nparallel with the wall as a tablet upon which to inscribe in letters\nof flame their undying affection. One Sunday morning, as Mrs. Idiot and\nI started for church, we were horrified to find our flagstones scribbled\nall over with poetry, done in chalk, after the order of\n\n \"Roses is pink, and violets is blue,\n Sugar is sweet, and so be you. [Illustration: \"'THE PICTURE OF A HEART WITH AN ARROW DRAWN THROUGH\nIT'\"]\n\n\"Further along was the picture of a heart with an arrow drawn through\nit, and the two names 'Larry' and 'Mame' written on either side. And one\nunusually affectionate youth had actually cut the initials of his young\nlady and himself in the top of the coping, with a cold-chisel, I\nsuspect. It's there yet. It was then my spirit rose up into fierce\ndenunciation. That night, when the clans had gathered and were going\nthrough the initial stages I marched out in front of them, cleared my\nthroat ostentatiously, and made a speech. It was the most nervous speech\nI ever made; worse than after-dinner speaking by a good deal. I called\ntheir attention to how I had suffered: referred pathetically to the\ndestruction of the hedge; inveighed sarcastically against the\nOsage-orange man; told them in highly original fashion that worms, if\ntaken at the ebb that leads on to fortune, would surely turn and rend\ntheir persecutors, and that I'd had enough. I forgave them the hedge; I\nforgave them the annoyance they had cost me, but I asserted that I'd see\nthem all condemned to eternal celibacy before I would permit my sidewalk\nto be turned into an anthology of love, and my coping into an intaglio\nof eternal blessedness. I requested them if they wished to write poetry\nto write it upon their own hearths, and if they had any inscriptions to\ncut to chip in and buy an obelisk of their own and hieroglyph to their\nhearts' content. I even offered to buy them each a slate and pencil,\nwhich they might bring with them when they came, upon which to send\ntheir sentiments down to posterity, and I finished with what I consider\nto be a pleasing perversion of Longfellow's poem on the Woodman, with a\nfew lines beginning:\n\n \"Scribbler, spare that sidewalk. \"Then I departed, threatening to have them all arrested.\"\n\n\"Good!\" said the Poet. \"I didn't think you'd ever do it. You have nerve\nenough, but you are too good-natured.\"\n\n\"I wasn't good-natured then,\" said the Idiot, regretfully; \"and when I\ngot through I stalked back into the house, scolded Mollie, sent Tommy to\nbed, and behaved like a bear for the rest of the evening.\"\n\n\"And the people on the wall? They slunk away in despair, I suppose,\"\nsaid the Poet. \"Not they,\" said the Idiot; \"not by a long shot. They combined against\nme, and next morning when I started for town I found my sidewalk in\nworse shape than ever. One flag had written upon it the pleasing mandate\n'Go drown yourself.' Another bore the mystic word 'Chump' in great\ncapital letters, and at the end of my walk was a pastel portrait of\nmyself, of rough and awkward composition, labelled with my name in full. It took my hired man two weeks to scrub it out. And on the following\nHallowe'en they strung a huge banner on my telephone wires, inscribed\n'The Idiot Asylum,' and every blessed gate I have to my name had been\nremoved from the premises.\"\n\n\"What an outrage!\" cried the Poet. \"Not a bit of it. Merely a suburban ebullition,\" said the Idiot. \"They\ndon't mean anything by it.

In the first place, it spoils the appearance of the wall;\nin the second place, it is not efficacious; in the third place, it would\nplace me in a false position. Everybody'd soon be asking where I got all\nthose bottles. An Englishman drinks enough beer in the course of a week\nto keep his walls covered with broken bottles for a century.

    "text": "XIV\n\nSOME CONSIDERATION OF THE MOTH\n\n\"Do you know anything about the habits of moths?\" repeated the Idiot. \"Moths?\" echoed the Poet, eying the Idiot closely, the transition from\nlive wires to moths proving rather too sudden for his comprehension. \"No, I don't know anything about moths except that I have heard that\nthey are an unmitigated nuisance.\"\n\n\"They are worse than a nuisance,\" said the Idiot. \"They are a devouring\nelement, and they are worse than fire. If your house catches fire you\ncan summon an engine and have it put out, and what damage it does you\ncan collect for if you are careful enough to keep your possessions\ninsured; but with the moth it is different. There isn't any moth\ndepartment in town that you can ring up, nor is there a\nmoth-extinguisher that you can keep close at hand to fight them with. Furthermore, there is no moth-insurance company here or elsewhere to\nprotect the man who suffers damage at their teeth, that I know of. \"He is a mean, sneaking, underhanded element, the moth is. Fire has a\ndecent sense of the proprieties. Moths have none at all. When fire\nattacks you it smokes, and crackles, and hisses, and roars, and lets you\nknow in clarion tones that it has come. The moth steals upon you in the\ndead of night, and chews up your best trousers, gorges himself upon your\nwife's furs, tickles his palate with your swellest flannel golf-shirt,\nmunches away upon your handsomest rug, punches holes in your best\nsofa-cushions with his tusks, and then silently folds his tent and\nsteals away without so much as a thank-you for his meal. For unmitigated\nmeanness commend me to the moth!\"\n\n\"You seem to speak with feeling,\" said the Poet, with a smile. \"Have you\nsuffered?\"\n\n\n\n\"Suffered?\" cried the Idiot. \"Suffered is not the word. They have\ntortured me. Alongside of the moth and his nefarious work even a\nbook-agent pales into insignificance, and an unpaid grocer's bill\nbecomes an absolute pleasure. You can meet a book-agent on his own\nground, for you know his limitations. I have done so myself. Only\nyesterday one of them called upon me to sell me a Cyclopedia of Cookery,\nand before he got away I had actually sold him a copy of your poems.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said the Poet, shaking his head. \"You sold my gift, did you?\"\n\n\"Not a bit of it,\" laughed the Idiot. \"When your book came out I bought\na copy, and two days later you sent me another with an inscription,\nwhich I treasure affectionately. I sold him the one I bought.\"\n\n\"You are a beautiful Idiot,\" said the Poet, slapping his knee\nenthusiastically. \"I don't lay claim so much to beauty as to sublimity,\" said the Idiot,\nlighting a cigar. \"And even that is not to my credit. Beauty and\nsublimity are gifts. No amount of cultivation can produce genius when it\ndoes not exist. When I see a beautiful woman it is not she that I\nadmire. I admire the gracious Hand that made her.\"\n\n\"Give me that idea, old man!\" cried the Poet. \"It is yours from this on,\" said the Idiot, with a sigh. \"I am not equal\nto it. I may be able to think thoughts, but thoughts are of no more use\nto me than a piano is to a man who can't read music. But we are becoming\ndiscursive. We were talking about moths, not thoughts. You said that I\nmust have suffered, and I said that I had been tortured, and I have. My\nevening clothes have been ruined by them; my best shirts have been eaten\nby them; my silk hat, in which I have taken much pride, has four bald\nspots on its side because of their insatiable appetite, and as far as I\ncan find out, I have no redress. You can't sue a moth for damages, you\nknow, with any degree of satisfaction.\"\n\n\"Why should you expect to sue a moth for damages any more than to have a\nmosquito indicted for assault?\" suggested the Poet. \"Oh, as for that,\" said the Idiot, \"you can treat the mosquito without\nmuch difficulty. He merits capital punishment, and if you are yourself\nalert you can squash him at the moment of his crime. But the moth is\ndifferent. You are absolutely helpless in the face of him. He works\nin secret.\"\n\n\"I am told that there are such things as camphor-balls,\" observed the\nPoet. \"There are,\" said the Idiot. \"And I truly think the moth enjoys them as\nmuch as a young girl enjoys a military ball. Whenever we give a\ncamphor-ball the moths attend, and as far as I can find out dance all\nthrough it. They seem to enjoy functions of that nature.

Why not, therefore, admit that the moth serves a purpose in\nthe great scheme of life?\"\n\n\"My dear Poet,\" said the Idiot, \"far be it from me to deny the truth of\nwhat you say. There is hardly a living creature that I have ever\nencountered in all my life that has not had some truly utilitarian\nquality in its make-up. The lion is a splendid creature, and with the\nbear and the fox and the rhinoceros and the tapir he serves a purpose. They at least teach boys geography, and teach it interestingly. The boy\nwho knows where the tapir hath its lair knows more geography than I do. My son Tommy has learned more of geography from a visit to the circus\nwhere those animals are shown than he ever learned from books. I can\nquite see likewise the utilitarian value of the mosquito. He keeps the\nsea-shore from being overcrowded, and he prevents some people from\nsleeping too much. He is an accomplished vocalist, and from my own point\nof view is superior to a Wagner opera, since Wagner opera puts me to\nsleep, while the magnificent discords of the mosquito keep me awake. But\nthe moth is beyond me. What his contribution to the public welfare\nmay be I cannot reason out, although I have tried.\"\n\n\"And you find nothing in his favor?\" asked the Poet. \"Much,\" replied the Idiot, \"but he has no system. His mission is to eat\nold clothes, but he is such a very disgusting glutton that he does not\ndiscriminate between old and new, and I have no use for him. If in his\nsearch for a meal he would choose the garments of three years ago, which\nI ought not to wear because they are so old-fashioned as to make me\nconspicuous when I do wear them, it would be all right. But the moth is\nno such discriminating person. He is not a lover of old vintages. When\nhe calls in a number of his brother moths to dine at his expense he does\nnot treat them to an overcoat of '89, or to a dress-suit of '93, or to a\nsilk hat laid down in '95. He wants the latest thing, and as far as I\ncan find out he gets it. I have just been compelled to lay in a new\nstock of under and over clothes because the ones I had have been served\nupon his table.\"\n\n\"The moth must live,\" observed the Poet. \"I'm perfectly willing he should if he'll only discriminate,\" retorted\nthe Idiot. \"We have enough old clothes in this house, my dear Poet, to\ngive a banquet of seventeen courses to six hundred moths every night for\nthe next six months. If they would content themselves with that I should\nbe satisfied. But they won't. They eat up my new clothes; they destroy\nmy new hats; they munch away upon my most treasured golf-vests. That is\nwhy I asked you if you knew anything about moths. I am anxious to reform\nthem. As you have said, I have gone into inventing, and my inventions\nare wholly designed to meet long-felt wants in all households. The man\nwho invents a scheme to circumvent or properly to satisfy the appetite\nof the moth will find his name indissolubly linked with fame. I have\nthought, and thought, and thought about it. The moth must either be\ndomesticated or extinguished. I have tried to extinguish him, but\nwithout avail. When he has flown forth I have endeavored to punch him in\nthe head, and I have wasted my energy upon the unresponsive air. Did you\never undertake to punch a moth in the head?\"\n\n\"Never,\" said the Poet. \"I am not a fighter.\"\n\n\"My dear boy,\" rejoined the Idiot, \"I don't know a hero in real life or\nin fiction who could meet a moth on his own ground. I read about Mr. Willie B. Travers, of New York, who can drive four horses about the\narena at the horse show without turning a hair. I read about Emerson\nMcJones, of Boston, putting up his face against the administration on a\nquestion of national import. I have read of the prowess of Alexander, of\nC\u00e6sar, of D'Artagnan, of Bonaparte, and of Teddy Roosevelt, but there\nisn't a man among 'em who can fight the moth. You can bombard him with a\ngatling-gun loaded to the muzzle with camphor-balls, and he still waves\nhis banner defiantly in your face. You may lunge at him with a rapier,\nand he jumps lightly aside, and to express his contempt bites a hole in\nyour parlor hangings. You can turn the hose on him, and he soars\nbuoyantly away out of reach. You can't kill him, because you can't catch\nhim. You can't drive him away, and until we go back to the dress of the\nknights of old and wear nickel-plated steel clothing, and live in rooms\nof solid masonry, we can't starve him out.",

There is, therefore, only one\nthing to do, and that is to domesticate him. If you in the course of\nyour investigations into nature have ever discovered any trait in the\nmoth that science can lay hold upon, something through which we can\nappeal to his better nature, if he has such a thing, you will be\nconferring a great boon upon the whole domestic world. What I want to\nfind out is if he possesses some particularly well-defined taste; if\nthere is any one kind of texture or fabric that he likes better than\nanother. If there is such a thing I'll have a brand-new suit made of\nthat same material especially for him, furnish a nice comfortable, warm\nspot in the attic as a dining-room, and let him feed there forevermore,\nwhen and how he pleases. The manners and customs of moths are an open\nbook to most of us. His tastes are as mysterious as the ocean's depths.\"\n\nThe Poet shook his head dubiously. \"I am afraid, my dear Idiot, that you\nhave at last tackled a problem that will prove too much for you. How to\nget at the point you desire is, I fear, impossible of discovery,\" he\nsaid. \"It would seem so,\" replied the Idiot. \"But I shall not despair. If the\nordinary cook of commerce can be made humanly intelligent I do not see\nany reason why we should abandon so comparatively simple a proposition\nas the domesticization of the moth.\"\n\nTommy and Mollie had been listening with great interest, and as the\nIdiot finished Mollie observed that she thought the best way to do was\nto ask the moth what he liked most, but Tommy had a less conciliatory\nplan. \"Best thing's to get rid of 'em altogether, pa,\" he said. \"Mollie and\nI'll squash 'em for you for fi' cents apiece.\"\n\nWhich struck the Poet as the most practical idea that had been advanced\nduring the discussion.",

    "text": "XV\n\nSOME CONSIDERATION OF THE BURGLAR\n\n\"Are you ever bothered much by burglars off here in the country?\" asked\nMr. Pedagog one spring afternoon, as he and the Idiot and the youngsters\nstrolled about the Idiot's small farm. \"No,\" said the Idiot. \"They've only visited me twice.\"\n\n\"Only twice, eh?\" observed the Schoolmaster. \"Well, I should think that\nwas often enough, considering that you haven't lived here more than a\nyear and a half.\"\n\n\"It was,\" said the Idiot. \"I didn't say I wanted them to come again, did\nI?\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" returned Mr. Pedagog. \"But you said 'only twice,' as if\ntwo visits of that nature were less than might have been expected.\"\n\n\"Well, aren't they?\" asked the Idiot. \"Just make a little calculation. I've lived on this place precisely five hundred and ninety-four days,\nand, of course, an equal number of nights. It seems to me that in\nbreaking into my house only twice when they might have come every night\nshows a degree of restraint upon our Suburban Burglary Company that is\nworthy of the highest commendation. You, of course, refer to\nprofessional burglars, don't you?\"\n\nMr. Pedagog laughed. \"Are there any amateur burglars?\"\n\n\"Are there!\" ejaculated the Idiot. \"Well, rather. There is the Gasman,\nand man who inspects the water-meter, and the Iceman, and the Plumber. If you refer to that class, why, I have them with me always.\"\n\n\"Which of the two classes do you prefer?\" asked Mr. Pedagog, with a\nchuckle. \"Well, I'm not quite sure as to that,\" returned the Idiot. \"I've often\nwondered myself whether I preferred the straight-out honest pirate, who\ndoes his work surreptitiously by night, and who doesn't pretend to be\nanything but a pirate, or the sleek, insinuating chap, who comes into\nour house by day, and runs up a bill against you which in his heart of\nhearts he knows is not a proper one. There are burglars and burglars in\nthis world, Mr. Pedagog, and the one who lands in the penitentiary is\nnot always a bigger rascal than the fellow who holds the respect of the\ncommunity and sets himself up as a prominent citizen. Highwaymen may be\ndivided into classes, some of them respectable, others not. There was\nDick Turpin, who ran honest risks to obtain a living; there are men in\nWall Street who work greater ruin, and are held in higher esteem. There\nis the footpad who takes your watch, and pawns it to buy bread for his\nstarving family, and there is the very charming young person who sits\nbehind a table at a church fair, and charges you seven dollars for a\nfifty-cent sofa-cushion. So it goes. Socially I prefer the esteemed\ncitizen who makes me pay twenty-eight dollars for ten dollars' worth of\ngas; but when it comes down to a strict business basis I must say I have\nlost less money through the operations of the professional thief than\nthrough those of the amateur highwayman. Take a recent case in my own\nexperience, for instance. Only last week I sent anonymously a small\nclock which cost me twenty dollars to a guild fair here in town, and\nMrs. Idiot bought it for a birthday present for me for forty dollars. In\nother words, I have a twenty-dollar clock on my hands that has cost me\nsixty dollars.\"\n\n\"But you have the satisfaction of knowing that you have contributed to\nthe good work of the guild,\" suggested Mr. Pedagog. \"That is true enough,\" said the Idiot; \"but the guild is only forty\ndollars to the good. They'd have been better off if I had given them\nfifty dollars in cash, and I'd have saved ten.\"\n\n\"But you have the clock,\" insisted Mr. Pedagog. \"I certainly have,\" replied the Idiot; \"and if time is money I shall\nsoon be rich, for that clock makes time to beat the band. If it keeps on\nas it has started and we stand by it, we shall soon be about a month\nahead of the sun. It gains a week every forty-eight hours. If that clock\nwere truthful, I should be a centenarian at forty.\"\n\n\"But you're not sorry you gave it?\" said Mr. Pedagog, deprecatingly. \"Not at all,\" said the Idiot. \"My only regret is that Mrs. I. bought it. But,\" he added, hastily, \"she needn't know that.\"\n\n\"I won't say a word,\" said Mr. Pedagog. \"I won't, neither, pa,\" said Tommy, with a degree of complacency which\nshowed that the temptation to tell was great. \"Well, I won't say mor'n two or three words about it, anyhow,\" put in\nMollie, not anxious to commit herself to perpetual silence on the\nsubject. \"It is the most beautiful clock I ever saw,\" said the Idiot, quickly,\nrealizing the possibilities of Mollie's two or three words. \"That's what I fink,\" said Mollie, \"and I'm goin' to tell mamma that you\nsaid so.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said the Idiot. \"Suppose you and Tommy run right up and\ntell her now.\"\n\n\"I'd rather hear you talk, pa,\" said Tommy. \"He does take after you, doesn't he?\" said Mr. Pedagog. \"Yes,\" said the Idiot, \"he does. He likes to hear me talk as much as I\ndo, bless him!\"\n\n\"It is a commendable sign in a son,\" observed Mr. Pedagog. \"But tell\nabout the two professionals. Did they get anything?\"\n\n\"They did,\" said the Idiot. \"And at the same time I lost nothing. The\nfirst chap came on the scene, along about two o'clock in the morning. He\nwas a very industrious mechanic, and I regret to say he was not\nadequately paid for his services. He tackled the safe.\" At this point\nthe Idiot threw back his head and laughed heartily. \"I have seen the safe,\" said Mr. Pedagog, \"and to tell you the truth, my\ndear Idiot, I have wondered at your choosing so obvious a receptacle for\nyour valuables. It does not, to my mind, deny itself as a safe should.",

It does not, to my mind, deny itself as a safe should. It advertises the fact that your silver, your wife's jewels perhaps, are\nwithin. I have spoken once or twice to our friend Mr. Brief about it.\"\n\n\"No doubt,\" replied the Idiot. \"However, I can't see why a safe has any\ndisadvantages.\"\n\n\"It lies in this,\" said Mr. Pedagog, impressively. \"You confess at once\nto the burglar the exact location of the things he's after. Without a\nsafe your silver, or Mrs. Idiot's jewels, such as they are, might be\nfound anywhere in the house. But when you take the trouble to buy a\nsafe, any burglar in creation who has ordinary common-sense must know\nthat your valuables are concentrated in that one spot.\"\n\n\"That, I rejoice to say,\" said the Idiot, \"is the burglar's view.\"\n\n\"You should not rejoice,\" said Mr. Pedagog, with some of his old-time\nseverity. \"You make his work so comparatively easy that he is content to\nfollow a base profession, as you have termed it. Truly, I wonder at you. You place on your first floor a bald safe--\"\n\n\"I haven't seen any advertised as having a full head of hair,\" observed\nthe Idiot, complacently. \"You misunderstand me,\" said Mr. Pedagog. \"When I say bald I mean\nevident, plain, obvious. You practically say: Here are the things which\nI value. What is to be found within this safe, Mr. Burglar, _are the\nvery things you are after_. Therefore, say you to the burglar: Attack\nthis safe. Break it open, rifle it of its contents; in other words, here\nis the swag, as I believe it is called.\"\n\n\"You are wholly right,\" said the Idiot. \"I bought that safe for that\nprecise reason, and I bought a big one and a strong one. But you don't\nknow the story of that safe, do you, Mr. Pedagog?\"\n\n\"I do not,\" said the Schoolmaster. \"Then let me tell you,\" said the Idiot. \"That safe has been broken open,\nand by a professional burglar. The burglar had his tools, and he had\nhis expert knowledge of their use. He arrived at my house, as I recall\nthe situation, somewhere about--ah--two o'clock at night. He bored at\nthe lock until three. He fooled about the combination. He did everything\nthat a respectable burglar might be expected to do, and--\"\n\n\"He failed, of course, since you say you have lost nothing,\" said Mr. Pedagog. \"Not at all,\" said the Idiot. \"After two hours and fifty-five minutes'\nwork on that safe he got it open. And--\"\n\n\"And?\" queried Mr. Pedagog. \"He found it empty,\" said the Idiot; \"absolutely empty. There was not a\nspoon, a fork, a tea-pot, or a diamond necklace, or even a scrap of\npaper in it.\"\n\n\"Then why do you have it,\" said Mr. Pedagog. \"Merely to keep the burglar busy while he is in my house, and to make\nhim expert in honest work. An ordinary mechanic, intelligent enough to\nget that safe open by night or by day, would be entitled to at least two\ndollars for his services. The individual involved got it open; and when\nhe opened it--\"\n\n\"Found nothing!\" cried Mr. Pedagog. \"Exactly,\" said the Idiot, pulling away on his cigar. \"I suppose I\nshould have left a check inside payable to bearer for a dollar and a\nhalf to compensate him for his trouble, but I am so neglectful that I\nreally didn't.\"\n\n\"And you bought a safe--\"\n\n\"Merely to provide employment for the unemployed burglar,\" said the\nIdiot. \"That is all a safe is good for, Mr. Pedagog. Experience has\nshown that the house-safe isn't worth the paint it is covered with in\nthe matter of protection. But as a decoy it works to a charm. A safe, in\nother words, is a splendid thing to keep things out of, as well as to\nkeep the burglar busy while he is your guest. If our particular visitor\nhad not spent all his time breaking the safe open he might have been\nable to locate our spoons.\"\n\n\"It is a pity,\" said Mr. Pedagog, dryly, \"that you did not add to the\nimpression the futility of his work made upon his mind a short note of\nadmonition indicating to him that he might be in better business.\"\n\n\"My dear Mr. Pedagog,\" said the Idiot, \"that would have been rude. Invited or otherwise, the man was a guest in my house, and a note of\nthat kind would have savored of sarcasm, or, if not, would have placed\nme in the position of having taken advantage of my guest's weakness to\nbe facetious at his expense.\"\n\n\"You take an original view of it,\" said Mr. Pedagog. \"Not a bit of it,\" returned the Idiot. \"I got the idea from a Boston\ngirl.",

Once when she and her sister-in-law found themselves alone at\nnight in a huge country-house they were suddenly overcome with fear of\nburglars, and rather than run any personal risk from the midnight\nmarauder they left a big card on top of the safe inscribed with these\nwords: 'Dear Sir,--The combination of this safe is 11-16-91. There is\nnothing in it. If you must have our silver, call at the Shawmut Safe\nDeposit Company, where it is now stored.' The two girls were cousins of\nmine.\"\n\nThe Schoolmaster smiled again. \"There must be a streak of your\nparticular kind of genius running all through your family,\" said he. \"True--there is,\" said the Idiot. \"I'm not the only Idiot in my tribe.\"\n\n\"And the second burglar. How about him?\" asked Mr. Pedagog. \"Oh, he was easy,\" said the Idiot. \"I compromised with him. You see, I\nmet him on his way out. I was coming home late, and just as I arrived he\nwas leaving. I invited him back, lit the gas in the dining-room, and\nasked him to join me in a bit of cold tongue and a bottle of beer. He\ntried to shuffle out of it, but when I said I preferred to reason with\nhim rather than have him arrested he sat down, and we talked the\nsituation over. I discovered that for about three hundred dollars' worth\nof my stuff that he had in a bag slung over his shoulder he might get as\nmuch as fifty dollars, and at great risk. I showed him how foolish that\nwas, and offered to give him forty dollars if he'd leave the stuff, so\nsaving me two hundred and sixty dollars, and avoiding all trouble for\nhimself. He didn't like it at first, but under the genial influence of\nthe beer and the cold tongue and my conversation he finally yielded, and\nwalked out of my house with a check drawn to bearer for forty dollars in\nhis pocket.\"\n\n\"I am astonished at you!\" cried Mr. Pedagog. \"You compounded a felony.\"\n\n\"Not exactly,\" said the Idiot. \"I should have done so if I hadn't\nstopped payment on the check the next day.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Mr. Pedagog, \"I see!\"\n\n\"All I lost was the revenue-stamp on the check,\" said the Idiot. \"And did you ever hear from the man again?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" observed the Idiot. \"I met him on the train a day or two\nlater--sat next to him in the smoking-car, in fact.\"\n\n\"And did he know you?\"\n\n\"Yes. We had a very pleasant chat going to town. He said he was moving\naway from here. He couldn't stand it, he said. He was going to work in\nsome new field where a man could get living pay for his work. Said he'd\nbeen robbed by some of our best people; what's the use of working for\nnothing? he asked. The poor man was kept down, and all that sort of\ntalk.\"\n\n\"And you parted friends?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the Idiot. \"I felt rather sorry for him, and when he said\ngood-bye I gave him a cigar and a five-dollar bill, and that was the end\nof him. I have since received a letter from him in which he said that my\nkindness was appreciated, and that I could leave my valuables out on the\nlawn all night hereafter with perfect impunity. 'There isn't a thief in\nour whole suburban gang would be mean enough to touch it after your\nkindness to me,' he wrote.\"\n\n\"Extraordinary!\" said Mr. Pedagog. \"Very,\" said the Idiot. \"Nevertheless, I have not taken his hint about\nleaving my silver out-of-doors, and have worked as hard as ever on my\npatent burglar-alarm.\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed! Have you a new idea in that line?\" asked the Schoolmaster. \"Yes,\" said the Idiot. \"It is wholly novel. It is designed to alarm the\nburglar, and not scare the people in the house. Did you ever hear of\nanything like that before?\"\n\n\"Never!\" ejaculated Mr. Pedagog, with enthusiasm. \"How is it to work?\"\n\n\"That,\" said the Idiot, \"is what I am trying to find out.

LAST CALL\n\nHandsomely engraved, a card bearing the above inscription was sent about\nthe middle of May to all the Idiot's old friends of Mrs. Smithers-Pedagog's select home for gentlemen, and it is needless to say\nthat they all accepted. \"I wonder what the dickens he means by 'Last Call,'\" said Mr. Brief to\nthe Genial Old Gentleman who occasionally imbibed. \"Sounds like the\nwarning of the dining-car porter on a Pullman train.\"\n\n\"I'm sure I can't imagine,\" said the other; \"and what's more, I'm\ncontent to wait and find out. Of course you are going?\"\n\n\"I am, indeed,\" said Mr. Brief. \"I'd travel farther than that for the\npleasure of an hour with the dear old boy, and particularly now that he\nhas so good a cook. Dined there lately?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the Genial Old Gentleman. \"Had any of those mulled sardines he gives you Sunday nights?\"\n\n\"More than was good for me. Ain't they fine?\" said the Genial Old\nGentleman, smacking his lips ecstatically. \"Immense!\" said Mr. Brief. \"A cook that can mull sardines like that is\nworth her weight in gold. Where do you suppose he got her?\"\n\n\"Why, he married her!\" cried the Genial Old Gentleman, promptly. \"Mrs. Idiot cooks those herself, on the chafing-dish. Didn't you know that?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Mr. Brief. \"I happened in late Sunday night, and we had 'em. They were so awfully good I didn't do a thing but eat, and forgot to\nask who cooked 'em.\"\n\n\"It's the way of the world,\" sighed the Genial Old Gentleman. \"We old\nbachelors have to get along on what comes to us, but the energetic chap\nwho goes out into the world and marries the right sort of a woman--Jove,\nwhat a lucky chap he is!\"\n\n\"There's some truth in that,\" agreed Mr. Brief; \"but, on the whole, just\nthink what a terrible thing it would be to marry a bad cook, and to have\nto eat everything she prepared with an outward show of delight just to\nkeep peace in the family.\"\n\n\"That's your cautious lawyer's view of it,\" said the Genial Old\nGentleman. \"Why the deuce don't you get married yourself, then,\" said Mr. Brief. \"If you feel that way--\"\n\n\"I don't want to,\" said the Genial Old Gentleman. \"Fact is, Brief, old\nman, all I should ever marry for would be the comfort of a home, and I\ncan always get that by going up to the Idiot's.\"\n\nThe other invited guests were no less perplexed by the final words of\nthe Idiot's invitation, and with the pleasure of accepting was mingled\nan agreeable curiosity to know what was meant by \"Last Call.\" The\nevening came, and all were present. It was a goodly company, and by\nspecial favor the children were allowed to sit up and partake; and, what\nwas more, Mary, the housemaid of the old days, assisted in the serving\nof the dinner. \"Seems like old times,\" said Mr. Whitechoker, beaming at Mrs. Pedagog\nand smiling pleasantly at Mary. \"I shall almost expect our host to be\nsarcastic.\"\n\n\"Sarcasm, Mr. Whitechoker,\" said the Idiot, unfolding his napkin, \"is\nall right in its place, but as I have grown older I haven't found that\nhaving given rein to it I was happier afterwards. Sometimes, no doubt,\nMrs. Pedagog has thought me rude--\"\n\n\"Never!\" said the ancient landlady. \"Well, there's something worse than having others think you rude,\" said\nthe Idiot. \"That's realizing yourself that you have been so, and I hope\nMrs. Pedagog will accept here and now an apology--a blanket\napology--which shall cover a multitude of past sins.\"\n\n\"My dear Idiot,\" said Mrs. Pedagog, \"do you know how I have always\nthought of you?\"\n\n\"As a son,\" said Mr. Pedagog. \"And I have felt towards you as a father.\"\n\n\"I wonder you didn't give me a thrashing once in a while, then,\" said\nthe Idiot. \"We have often wished to,\" observed Mr. Pedagog. \"John!\" cried Mrs. Pedagog. \"Well, _I_ have,\" said Mr. Pedagog. \"Mrs. Pedagog has all the amiable\nweakness of a woman towards her naughty boy. Spank him next time, not\nthis.\"\n\nEverybody laughed, and the Idiot rose from his place and walked to Mrs. Pedagog's side and kissed her. \"You're a nice old mommie,\" he said, \"and the naughty boy loves you. He'll be hanged if he'll kiss his daddy, though!\" he added, with a\nglance at Mr. Pedagog. \"I will,\" said Mollie; and she did so. The old Schoolmaster returned the little girl's salute with emphasis. \"Bless you, little one!\" he said, huskily. \"I love you even as I loved\nyour papa.\"\n\n\"I'm a-goin' to kiss everybody,\" said Tommy; and he started in with Mary\nand put his little scheme through to the bitter end. \"What are we going\nto have for dessert?\" he added, complacently, as he resumed his seat. \"Idiot,\" said Mr. Brief, when the third course had been served, \"what do\nyou mean by 'Last Call?'\"\n\n\"We are going to give up housekeeping,\" said the Idiot. \"No trouble, I hope,\" said Mr. Whitechoker. \"Lots!\" ejaculated the Idiot. \"But not very troublesome troubles. The\nfact is we intend to travel.\"\n\n\"To travel, eh?\" said the Genial Old Gentleman. \"Where?\"\n\n\"Abroad,\" replied the Idiot. \"We have never been abroad, you know. I've\nbeen abroad, and Mrs. Idiot has been abroad, but _we_ have never been\nabroad. We are going together this time, and we are going to take the\nchildren, and for a year we propose to see Europe under the most\nfavorable conditions. I think that abroad will seem a little different\nif we go together.\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly,\" said Mr. Whitechoker. \"But London is a cold, godless\nplace.\"\n\n\"It is if you go alone,\" said the Idiot. \"And Paris is vile,\" suggested Mr. Brief. \"To the man who has only himself to think of,\" said the Idiot.",

Now that we are\nrich we must accept the penalties imposed by modern society upon the\nwealthy. You never knew a rich man to lead a comfortable life, did you,\nMr. Pedagog?\"\n\n\"There are few of them who seem to know how,\" admitted the Schoolmaster. \"But--you do.\"\n\n\"No doubt,\" said the Idiot. \"But you see I do not wish to be\nostentatiously different from my kind, so having made a fortune I am\ngoing to live as people of fortune do and be as uncomfortable as I know\nhow.\"\n\n\"I don't understand about this fortune,\" said Mr. Brief. \"Have you run\nup against a rich uncle somewhere, or is this sudden wealth the result\nof your inventions, concerning which we have heard so much lately?\"\n\n\"Neither,\" replied the Idiot. \"The fact is, I made an investment some\nyears ago in a certain stock, for which I paid twenty-three. I sold it\nthree weeks ago for one hundred and sixty-three, clearing one hundred\nand forty dollars each on a thousand shares.\"\n\nThe Poet gasped. \"One hundred and forty thousand dollars profit!\" cried Mr. Whitechoker. \"Yes,\" said the Idiot, calmly, \"that's about the size of it. Terrible,\nisn't it? Here I was a happy man; content to stay at home and toil eight\nhours a day for a small stipend; living in tolerable comfort, and\nnothing to worry over. All of a sudden this thing happens, and like all\nother men of wealth I must become a wanderer. I shudder to think of what\nmight have happened if I'd made a million; I shouldn't have had a home\nat all then.\"\n\nThe guests looked at their host with amazement. To most of them he had\nreached the supreme moment of his idiocy. \"Ahem!\" said the Poet. \"I fail to see why.\"\n\n\"Look at the ways of the millionaire and you'll see,\" observed the\nIdiot, suavely. \"Given his million he gives up his house and builds\nhimself a small, first-class hotel in some big city, which for the\ngreater part of the year is occupied by servants. He next erects a\ncountry palace at Lenox or at Newport. This he calls a cottage, though\nit usually looks more like a public library or a hospital or a\nclub-house. Then he builds himself a camp, with stained-glass windows,\nin the Adirondacks, and has to float a small railroad in order to get\nhimself and his wife's trunks into camp. Shortly after these follows a\nbungalow modelled after a French ch\u00e2teau, somewhere in the South, and\nthen a yacht warranted to cross the ocean in ten days, and to produce\nsea-sickness twelve hours sooner than the regular ocean-steamer, becomes\none of the necessities of life. Result, he never lives anywhere. To\noccupy all his residences, camps, and bungalows he has to keep eternally\non the move, and when he thinks he needs a trip to Europe he has his\nyacht got ready and sends it over, going himself on a fast steamer. He\nmeets his yacht at Southampton, and orders the captain to proceed\ndirectly to some Mediterranean port, going himself, meanwhile, to\nLondon. After a month of London he goes to Paris, and thence to the\nMediterranean port, where, after steaming aboard of the yacht for three\nor four days, he sends the boat back to New York and returns himself by\nthe regular liner. Oh, it's a terrible thing to be a millionaire and\nhave nowhere to lay one's head, with every poorer man envying you, many\nhating you, and hands raised against you everywhere.\"\n\nThere was a pause, and the assembled company properly expressed their\nappreciation of the millionaire's hard lot by silence. \"The scheme has its advantages,\" observed Mrs. Idiot. \"Some,\" said the Idiot. \"But think, my dear, of the town house with\nthirty-nine servants; the Newport house with thirty-four; the camp with\nsixty, including gamekeepers and guides; the bungalow with thirty more,\nand the yacht with a captain, a crew, stewards, stewardesses, and a cook\nyou can't get away from without jumping overboard.

If it wasn't for Mary, who keeps an eye on\nthings, I don't know what we should do.\"\n\n\"Well, I am glad you're rich, pa,\" said Tommy; \"you can increase my\nallowance.\"\n\n\"And I can have a pony,\" lisped Mollie. \"Alas! Poor children!\" cried the Idiot. \"That is the saddest part of\nwealth. Instead of bringing the little ones up ourselves, to be wholly\nfashionable it will be necessary to sublet the contract to a committee\nof tutors and governesses. The obligations of social life hereafter will\nrequire that we meet our children by appointment only, and that when\nthey dine they shall eat in solitary grandeur until they become so\npolished in manners that their parents may once more formally welcome\nthem at table. All the good old democratic ways of the domestic republic\nare now to be set aside. Tommy, instead of yelling for a buckwheat-cake\nat the top of his lungs, upon our return will request a butler in\nchoicest French to hand him a _p\u00e2t\u00e9 de foie gras_; and dear little\nMollie will have to give up attracting the waitress' attention by shying\nan olive-pit at her and imperiously summon her by means of an electric\nbuzzer set to buzzing with her toe.\"\n\n\"Mercy! What a picture of woe!\" cried Mr. Pedagog. \"Not altogether true, is it?\" suggested the Doctor. \"Have you ever visited Newport?\" asked the Idiot. \"No,\" said the Doctor, \"never.\"\n\n\"Well, don't,\" said the Idiot, \"unless you wish to look upon that\npicture--a picture of life whence childhood is abolished; where _blas\u00e9_\nlittle swells take the place of lively small boys, and diminutive grand\nduchesses, clad in regal garb, have supplanted the little daughters who\nbring smiles and sunshine into the life of the common people. Ah, my\nfriends,\" the Idiot continued, with a shake of his head, \"there are sad\nsights to be seen in this world, but I know of none sadder than those\nrich little scions of the American aristocracy in whose veins the good\nred blood of a not very remote ancestry has turned blue through too much\nhigh living and too little real living.\"\n\n\"I should think you'd take that hundred and forty thousand dollars and\nthrow it into the sea,\" said Mr. Brief. \"That would be wicked waste,\" observed the Idiot. \"I propose to use it\nto win back the good old home-life, and the best way to perpetuate that\nis to leave it for a time and travel. When you have travelled and seen\nhow uncomfortable others are, and discovered how uncomfortable you are\nwhile travelling, nothing can exceed the bliss of getting back to the\nfirst simple principles of the real home.\"\n\n\"As a sensible man, why don't you stay here, then?\" queried the Poet. \"Because,\" said the Idiot, \"if I stayed here with that hundred and forty\nthousand dollars on my mind I should nurse it, and in a short while I'd\nbecome a millionaire, and such a misfortune as that I shall never\ninvite. We shall go abroad and spend--\"\n\n\"Not all of it, I hope?\" said Mr. Whitechoker. \"No,\" replied the Idiot. \"But enough of it to mitigate the horrors of\nour condition while absent.\"\n\nAnd so it was that Castle Idiot was closed, and that for a time at least\n\"The Idiot at Home\" became a thing of the past.

At\na glance you can see what a fine, round, splendid fellow Bunyip Bluegum\nis, without me telling you. At a second glance you can see that the\nUncle is more square than round, and that his face has whiskers on it. [Illustration]\n\nLooked at sideways you can still see what a splendid fellow Bunyip is,\nthough you can only see one of his Uncle's whiskers. [Illustration]\n\nObserved from behind, however, you completely lose sight of the\nwhiskers, and so fail to realize how immensely important they are. In\nfact, these very whiskers were the chief cause of Bunyip's leaving home\nto see the world, for, as he often said to himself--\n\n 'Whiskers alone are bad enough\n Attached to faces coarse and rough;\n But how much greater their offence is\n When stuck on Uncles' countenances.'\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe plain truth was that Bunyip and his Uncle lived in a small house in\na tree, and there was no room for the whiskers. What was worse, the\nwhiskers were red, and they blew about in the wind, and Uncle\nWattleberry would insist on bringing them to the dinner table with him,\nwhere they got in the soup. Bunyip Bluegum was a tidy bear, and he objected to whisker soup, so he\nwas forced to eat his meals outside, which was awkward, and besides,\nlizards came and borrowed his soup. [Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\nHis Uncle refused to listen to reason on the subject of his whiskers. It\nwas quite useless giving him hints, such as presents of razors, and\nscissors, and boxes of matches to burn them off. On such occasions he\nwould remark--\n\n 'Shaving may add an air that's somewhat brisker,\n For dignity, commend me to the whisker.'\n\nOr, when more deeply moved, he would exclaim--\n\n 'As noble thoughts the inward being grace,\n So noble whiskers dignify the face.'\n\nPrayers and entreaties to remove the whiskers being of no avail, Bunyip\ndecided to leave home without more ado. The trouble was that he couldn't make up his mind whether to be a\nTraveller or a Swagman. You can't go about the world being nothing, but\nif you are a traveller you have to carry a bag, while if you are a\nswagman you have to carry a swag, and the question is: Which is the\nheavier? [Illustration]\n\nAt length he decided to put the matter before Egbert Rumpus Bumpus, the\npoet, and ask his advice. He found Egbert busy writing poems on a slate. He was so busy that he only had time to sing out--\n\n 'Don't interrupt the poet, friend,\n Until his poem's at an end.'\n\nand went on writing harder than ever. He wrote all down one side of the\nslate and all up the other, and then remarked--\n\n 'As there's no time to finish that,\n The time has come to have our chat. Be quick, my friend, your business state,\n Before I take another slate.'\n\n[Illustration]\n\n'The fact is,' said the Bunyip, 'I have decided to see the world, and I\ncannot make up my mind whether to be a Traveller or a Swagman. Which\nwould you advise?'\n\nThen said the Poet--\n\n 'As you've no bags it's plain to see\n A traveller you cannot be;\n And as a swag you haven't either\n You cannot be a swagman neither. For travellers must carry bags,\n And swagmen have to hump their swags\n Like bottle-ohs or ragmen. As you have neither swag nor bag\n You must remain a simple wag,\n And not a swag- or bagman.'\n\n[Illustration]\n\n'Dear me,' said Bunyip Bluegum, 'I never thought of that. What must I do\nin order to see the world without carrying swags or bags?'\n\nThe Poet thought deeply, put on his eyeglass, and said impressively--\n\n 'Take my advice, don't carry bags,\n For bags are just as bad as swags;\n They're never made to measure. To see the world, your simple trick\n Is but to take a walking-stick--\n Assume an air of pleasure,\n And tell the people near and far\n You stroll about because you are\n A Gentleman of Leisure.'\n\n[Illustration]\n\n'You have solved the problem,' said Bunyip Bluegum, and, wringing his\nfriend's hand, he ran straight home, took his Uncle's walking-stick, and\nassuming an air of pleasure, set off to see the world. He found a great many things to see, such as dandelions, and ants, and\ntraction engines, and bolting horses, and furniture being removed,\nbesides being kept busy raising his hat, and passing the time of day\nwith people on the road, for he was a very well-bred young fellow,\npolite in his manners, graceful in his attitudes, and able to converse\non a great variety of subjects, having read all the best Australian\npoets. Unfortunately, in the hurry of leaving home, he had forgotten to\nprovide himself with food, and at lunch time found himself attacked by\nthe pangs of hunger. 'Dear me,' he said, 'I feel quite faint. I had no idea that one's\nstomach was so important. I have everything I require, except food; but\nwithout food everything is rather less than nothing. 'I've got a stick to walk with. I've got a mind to think with. I've got a voice to talk with. I've got an eye to wink with. I've lots of teeth to eat with,\n A brand new hat to bow with,\n A pair of fists to beat with,\n A rage to have a row with.",

For here am I without a crumb\n To satisfy a raging tum--\n O what an oversight!'\n\nAs he was indulging in these melancholy reflexions he came round a bend\nin the road, and discovered two people in the very act of having lunch. These people were none other than Bill Barnacle, the sailor, and his\nfriend, Sam Sawnoff, the penguin bold. Bill was a small man with a large hat, a beard half as large as his hat,\nand feet half as large as his beard. Sam Sawnoff's feet were sitting\ndown and his body was standing up, because his feet were so short and\nhis body so long that he had to do both together. They had a pudding in\na basin, and the smell that arose from it was so delightful that Bunyip\nBluegum was quite unable to pass on. [Illustration]\n\n'Excuse me,' he said, raising his hat, 'but am I right in supposing that\nthis is a steak-and-kidney pudding?'\n\n'At present it is,' said Bill Barnacle. 'It smells delightful,' said Bunyip Bluegum. 'It is delightful,' said Bill, eating a large mouthful. Bunyip Bluegum was too much of a gentleman to invite himself to lunch,\nbut he said carelessly, 'Am I right in supposing that there are onions\nin this pudding?'\n\nBefore Bill could reply, a thick, angry voice came out of the pudding,\nsaying--\n\n 'Onions, bunions, corns and crabs,\n Whiskers, wheels and hansom cabs,\n Beef and bottles, beer and bones,\n Give him a feed and end his groans.'\n\n'Albert, Albert,' said Bill to the Puddin', 'where's your manners?'\n\n'Where's yours?' said the Puddin' rudely, 'guzzling away there, and\nnever so much as offering this stranger a slice.'\n\n'There you are,' said Bill. 'There's nothing this Puddin' enjoys more\nthan offering slices of himself to strangers.'\n\n'How very polite of him,' said Bunyip, but the Puddin' replied loudly--\n\n 'Politeness be sugared, politeness be hanged,\n Politeness be jumbled and tumbled and banged. It's simply a matter of putting on pace,\n Politeness has nothing to do with the case.'\n\n[Illustration]\n\n'Always anxious to be eaten,' said Bill, 'that's this Puddin's mania. Well, to oblige him, I ask you to join us at lunch.'\n\n'Delighted, I'm sure,' said Bunyip, seating himself. 'There's nothing I\nenjoy more than a good go in at steak-and-kidney pudding in the open\nair.'\n\n'Well said,' remarked Sam Sawnoff, patting him on the back. 'Hearty\neaters are always welcome.'\n\n'You'll enjoy this Puddin',' said Bill, handing him a large slice. 'This\nis a very rare Puddin'.'\n\n'It's a cut-an'-come-again Puddin',' said Sam. 'It's a Christmas, steak, and apple-dumpling Puddin',' said Bill. 'It's a--Shall I tell him?' he asked, looking at Bill. Bill nodded, and\nthe Penguin leaned across to Bunyip Bluegum and said in a low voice,\n'It's a Magic Puddin'.'\n\n'No whispering,' shouted the Puddin' angrily. 'Speak up. Don't strain a\nPuddin's ears at the meal table.'\n\n'No harm intended, Albert,' said Sam, 'I was merely remarking how well\nthe crops are looking. Call him Albert when addressing him,' he added to\nBunyip Bluegum. 'It soothes him.'\n\n'I am delighted to make your acquaintance, Albert,' said Bunyip. 'No soft soap from total strangers,' said the Puddin', rudely. 'Don't take no notice of him, mate,' said Bill. 'That's only his rough\nand ready way. What this Puddin' requires is politeness and constant\neatin'.'\n\nThey had a delightful meal, eating as much as possible, for whenever\nthey stopped eating the Puddin' sang out--\n\n 'Eat away, chew away, munch and bolt and guzzle,\n Never leave the table till you're full up to the muzzle.'\n\n[Illustration]\n\nBut at length they had to stop, in spite of these encouraging remarks,\nand, as they refused to eat any more, the Puddin' got out of his basin,\nremarking--'If you won't eat any more here's giving you a run for the\nsake of exercise', and he set off so swiftly on a pair of extremely thin\nlegs that Bill had to run like an antelope to catch him up. 'My word,' said Bill, when the Puddin' was brought back. 'You have to be\nas smart as paint to keep this Puddin' in order. He's that artful,\nlawyers couldn't manage him. Put your hat on, Albert, like a little\ngentleman,' he added, placing the basin on his head. He took the\nPuddin's hand, Sam took the other, and they all set off along the road. A peculiar thing about the Puddin' was that, though they had all had a\ngreat many slices off him, there was no sign of the place whence the\nslices had been cut. 'That's where the Magic comes in,' explained Bill. 'The more you eats\nthe more you gets. Cut-an'-come-again is his name, an' cut, an' come\nagain, is his nature.",

Perhaps,' he added, 'you would\nlike to hear how we came to own this remarkable Puddin'.'\n\n'Nothing would please me more,' said Bunyip Bluegum. 'In that case,' said Bill, 'let her go for a song.'\n\n[Illustration]\n\n 'Ho, the cook of the _Saucy Sausage_,\n Was a feller called Curry and Rice,\n A son of a gun as fat as a tun\n With a face as round as a hot-cross bun,\n Or a barrel, to be precise. 'One winter's morn we rounds the Horn,\n A-rollin' homeward bound. We strikes on the ice, goes down in a trice,\n And all on board but Curry and Rice\n And me an' Sam is drowned. [Illustration]\n\n 'For Sam an' me an' the cook, yer see,\n We climbs on a lump of ice,\n And there in the sleet we suffered a treat\n For several months from frozen feet,\n With nothin' at all but ice to eat,\n And ice does not suffice. 'And Sam and me we couldn't agree\n With the cook at any price. We was both as thin as a piece of tin\n While that there cook was busting his skin\n On nothin' to eat but ice. [Illustration]\n\n 'Says Sam to me, \"It's a mystery\n More deep than words can utter;\n Whatever we do, here's me an' you,\n Us both as thin as Irish stoo,\n While he's as fat as butter.\"\n\n 'But late one night we wakes in fright\n To see by a pale blue flare,\n That cook has got in a phantom pot\n A big plum-duff an' a rump-steak hot,\n And the guzzlin' wizard is eatin' the lot,\n On top of the iceberg bare.'\n\n'There's a verse left out here,' said Bill, stopping the song, 'owin' to\nthe difficulty of explainin' exactly what happened, when me and Sam\ndiscovered the deceitful nature of that cook. The next verse is as\nfollows--\n\n 'Now Sam an' me can never agree\n What happened to Curry and Rice. The whole affair is shrouded in doubt,\n For the night was dark and the flare went out,\n And all we heard was a startled shout,\n Though I think meself, in the subsequent rout,\n That us bein' thin, an' him bein' stout,\n In the middle of pushin' an' shovin' about,\n He--MUST HAVE FELL OFF THE ICE.'\n\n'That won't do, you know,' began the Puddin', but Sam said hurriedly,\n'It was very dark, and there's no sayin' at this date what happened.'\n\n'Yes there is,' said the Puddin', 'for I had my eye on the whole affair,\nand it's my belief that if he hadn't been so round you'd have never\nrolled him off the iceberg, for you was both singin' out \"Yo heave Ho\"\nfor half an hour, an' him trying to hold on to Bill's beard.'\n\n[Illustration]\n\n'In the haste of the moment,' said Bill, 'he may have got a bit of a\nshove, for the ice bein' slippy, and us bein' justly enraged, and him\nbein' as round as a barrel, he may, as I said, have been too fat to save\nhimself from rollin' off the iceberg. The point, however, is immaterial\nto our story, which concerns this Puddin'; and this Puddin',' said Bill\npatting him on the basin, 'was the very Puddin' that Curry and Rice\ninvented on the iceberg.'\n\n'He must have been a very clever cook,' said Bunyip. 'He was, poor feller, he was,' said Bill, greatly affected. 'For plum\nduff or Irish stoo there wasn't his equal in the land. But enough of\nthese sad subjects. Pausin' only to explain that me an' Sam got off the\niceberg on a homeward bound chicken coop, landed on Tierra del Fuego,\nwalked to Valparaiso, and so got home, I will proceed to enliven the\noccasion with \"The Ballad of the Bo'sun's Bride\".'\n\nAnd without more ado, Bill, who had one of those beef-and-thunder\nvoices, roared out--\n\n 'Ho, aboard the _Salt Junk Sarah_\n We was rollin' homeward bound,\n When the bo'sun's bride fell over the side\n And very near got drowned. Rollin' home, rollin' home,\n Rollin' home across the foam,\n She had to swim to save her glim\n And catch us rollin' home.'\n\nIt was a very long song, so the rest of it is left out here, but there\nwas a great deal of rolling and roaring in it, and they all joined in\nthe chorus. They were all singing away at the top of their pipe, as Bill\ncalled it, when round a bend in the road they came on two low-looking\npersons hiding behind a tree. One was a Possum, with one of those sharp,\nsnooting, snouting sort of faces, and the other was a bulbous,\nboozy-looking Wombat in an old long-tailed coat, and a hat that marked\nhim down as a man you couldn't trust in the fowlyard. They were busy\nsharpening up a carving knife on a portable grind-stone, but the moment\nthey caught sight of the travellers the Possum whipped the knife behind\nhim and the Wombat put his hat over the grindstone. Bill Barnacle flew into a passion at these signs of treachery. 'I see you there,' he shouted.",

'You can't see all of us,' shouted the Possum, and the Wombat added,\n''Cause why, some of us is behind the tree.'\n\n[Illustration]\n\nBill led the others aside, in order to hold a consultation. 'What on earth's to be done?' he said. 'We shall have to fight them, as usual,' said Sam. 'Why do you have to fight them?' asked Bunyip Bluegum. 'Because they're after our Puddin',' said Bill. 'They're after our Puddin',' explained Sam, 'because they're\nprofessional puddin'-thieves.'\n\n'And as we're perfessional Puddin'-owners,' said Bill, 'we have to fight\nthem on principle. The fighting,' he added, 'is a mere flea-bite, as the\nsayin' goes. The trouble is, what's to be done with the Puddin'?'\n\n'While you do the fighting,' said Bunyip bravely, 'I shall mind the\nPuddin'.'\n\n'The trouble is,' said Bill, 'that this is a very secret, crafty\nPuddin', an' if you wasn't up to his game he'd be askin' you to look at\na spider an' then run away while your back is turned.'\n\n'That's right,' said the Puddin', gloomily. 'Take a Puddin's character\naway. Don't mind his feelings.'\n\n[Illustration]\n\n'We don't mind your feelin's, Albert,' said Bill. 'What we minds is your\ntreacherous 'abits.' But Bunyip Bluegum said, 'Why not turn him\nupside-down and sit on him?'\n\n[Illustration]\n\n'What a brutal suggestion,' said the Puddin'; but no notice was taken of\nhis objections, and as soon as he was turned safely upside-down, Bill\nand Sam ran straight at the puddin'-thieves and commenced sparring up at\nthem with the greatest activity. 'Put 'em up, ye puddin'-snatchers,' shouted Bill. 'Don't keep us\nsparrin' up here all day. Come out an' take your gruel while you've got\nthe chance.'\n\nThe Possum wished to turn the matter off by saying, 'I see the price of\neggs has gone up again', but Bill gave him a punch on the snout that\nbent it like a carrot, and Sam caught the Wombat such a flip with his\nflapper that he gave in at once. 'I shan't be able to fight any more this afternoon,' said the Wombat,\n'as I've got sore feet.' The Possum said hurriedly, 'We shall be late\nfor that appointment', and they took their grindstone and off they went. [Illustration]\n\nBut when they were a safe distance away the Possum sang out: 'You'll\nrepent this conduct. You'll repent bending a man's snout so that he can\nhardly see over it, let alone breathe through it with comfort', and the\nWombat added, 'For shame, flapping a man with sore feet.'\n\n'We laugh with scorn at threats,' said Bill, and he added as a warning--\n\n 'I don't repent a snout that's bent,\n And if again I tap it,\n Oh, with a clout I'll bend that snout\n With force enough to snap it.'\n\nand Sam added for the Wombat's benefit--\n\n 'I take no shame to fight the lame\n When they deserve to cop it. So do not try to pipe your eye,\n Or with my flip I'll flop it.'\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe puddin'-thieves disappeared over the hill and, as the evening\nhappened to come down rather suddenly at that moment, Bill said,\n'Business bein' over for the day, now's the time to set about makin' the\ncamp fire.'\n\nThis was a welcome suggestion, for, as all travellers know, if you don't\nsit by a camp fire in the evening, you have to sit by nothing in the\ndark, which is a most unsociable way of spending your time. They found a\ncomfortable nook under the hedge, where there were plenty of dry leaves\nto rest on, and there they built a fire, and put the billy on, and made\ntea. The tea and sugar and three tin cups and half a pound of mixed\nbiscuits were brought out of the bag by Sam, while Bill cut slices of\nsteak-and-kidney from the Puddin'. After that they had boiled jam-roll\nand apple-dumpling, as the fancy took them, for if you wanted a change\nof food from the Puddin', all you had to do was to whistle twice and\nturn the basin round. After they had eaten as much as they wanted, the things were put away in\nthe bag, and they settled down comfortably for the evening. 'This is what I call grand,' said Bill, cutting up his tobacco. 'Full-and-plenty to eat, pipes goin' and the evenin's enjoyment before\nus. Tune up on the mouth-organ, Sam, an' off she goes with a song.'\n\nThey had a mouth-organ in the bag which they took turns at playing, and\nBill led off with a song which he said was called--\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\nSPANISH GOLD\n\n 'When I was young I used to hold\n I'd run away to sea,\n And be a Pirate brave and bold\n On the coast of Caribbee.",

'For I sez to meself, \"I'll fill me hold\n With Spanish silver and Spanish gold,\n And out of every ship I sink\n I'll collar the best of food and drink. '\"For Caribbee, or Barbaree,\n Or the shores of South Amerikee\n Are all the same to a Pirate bold,\n Whose thoughts are fixed on Spanish gold.\"\n\n 'So one fine day I runs away\n A Pirate for to be;\n But I found there was never a Pirate left\n On the coast of Caribbee. 'For Pirates go, but their next of kin\n Are Merchant Captains, hard as sin,\n And Merchant Mates as hard as nails\n Aboard of every ship that sails. 'And I worked aloft and I worked below,\n I worked wherever I had to go,\n And the winds blew hard and the winds blew cold,\n And I sez to meself as the ship she rolled,\n\n '\"O Caribbee! O Barbaree! O shores of South Amerikee! O, never go there: if the truth be told,\n You'll get more kicks than Spanish gold.\"'\n\n[Illustration]\n\n'And that's the truth, mate,' said Bill to Bunyip Bluegum. 'There ain't\nno pirates nowadays at sea, except western ocean First Mates, and many's\nthe bootin' I've had for not takin' in the slack of the topsail halyards\nfast enough to suit their fancy. It's a hard life, the sea, and Sam\nhere'll bear me out when I say that bein' hit on the head with a\nbelayin' pin while tryin' to pick up the weather earing is an\nexperience that no man wants twice. But toon up, and a song all round.'\n\n[Illustration]\n\n'I shall sing you the \"Penguin Bold\",' said Sam, and, striking a\ngraceful attitude, he sang this song--\n\n 'To see the penguin out at sea,\n And watch how he behaves,\n Would prove that penguins cannot be\n And never shall be slaves. You haven't got a notion\n How penguins brave the ocean\n And laugh with scorn at waves. 'To see the penguin at his ease\n Performing fearful larks\n With stingarees of all degrees,\n As well as whales and sharks;\n The sight would quickly let you know\n The great contempt that penguins show\n For stingarees and sharks. [Illustration]\n\n 'O see the penguin as he goes\n A-turning Catherine wheels,\n Without repose upon the nose\n Of walruses and seals. But bless your heart, a penguin feels\n Supreme contempt for foolish seals,\n While he never fails, where'er he goes,\n To turn back-flaps on a walrus nose.'\n\n'It's all very fine,' said the Puddin' gloomily, 'singing about the joys\nof being penguins and pirates, but how'd you like to be a Puddin' and be\neaten all day long?'\n\nAnd in a very gruff voice he sang as follows:--\n\n 'O, who would be a puddin',\n A puddin' in a pot,\n A puddin' which is stood on\n A fire which is hot? O sad indeed the lot\n Of puddin's in a pot. 'I wouldn't be a puddin'\n If I could be a bird,\n If I could be a wooden\n Doll, I would'n say a word. Yes, I have often heard\n It's grand to be a bird. 'But as I am a puddin',\n A puddin' in a pot,\n I hope you get the stomach ache\n For eatin' me a lot. I hope you get it hot,\n You puddin'-eatin' lot!'\n\n'Very well sung, Albert,' said Bill encouragingly, 'though you're a\ntrifle husky in your undertones, which is no doubt due to the gravy in\nyour innards. However, as a reward for bein' a bright little feller we\nshall have a slice of you all round before turnin' in for the night.'\n\nSo they whistled up the plum-duff side of the Puddin', and had supper. When that was done, Bill stood up and made a speech to Bunyip Bluegum. 'I am now about to put before you an important proposal,' said Bill. 'Here you are, a young intelligent feller, goin' about seein' the world\nby yourself. Here is Sam an' me, two as fine fellers as ever walked,\ngoin' about the world with a Puddin'. My proposal to you is--Join us,\nand become a member of the Noble Society of Puddin'-owners. The duties\nof the Society,' went on Bill, 'are light. The members are required to\nwander along the roads, indulgin' in conversation, song and story,\neatin' at regular intervals at the Puddin'. And now, what's your\nanswer?'\n\n'My answer,' said Bunyip Bluegum, 'is, Done with you.' And, shaking\nhands warmly all round, they loudly sang--\n\nTHE PUDDIN'-OWNERS' ANTHEM\n\n 'The solemn word is plighted,\n The solemn tale is told,\n We swear to stand united,\n Three puddin'-owners bold. 'When we with rage assemble,\n Let puddin'-snatchers groan;\n Let puddin'-burglars tremble,\n They'll ne'er our puddin' own. 'Hurrah for puddin'-owning,\n Hurrah for Friendship's hand,\n The puddin'-thieves are groaning\n To see our noble band.",

After such a busy day, walking, talking, fighting,\nsinging, and eating puddin', they were all asleep in a pig's whisper. Second Slice\n\nThe Society of Puddin'-owners were up bright and early next morning, and\nhad the billy on and tea made before six o'clock, which is the best part\nof the day, because the world has just had his face washed, and the air\nsmells like Pears' soap. 'Aha,' said Bill Barnacle, cutting up slices of the Puddin', 'this is\nwhat I call grand. Here we are, after a splendid night's sleep on dry\nleaves, havin' a smokin' hot slice of steak-and-kidney for breakfast\nround the camp fire. What could be more delightful?'\n\n'What indeed?' said Bunyip Bluegum sipping tea. 'Why, as I always say,' said Bill, 'if there's one thing more entrancin'\nthan sittin' round a camp fire in the evenin' it's sitting round a camp\nfire in the mornin'. No bed and blankets and breakfast tables for Bill\nBarnacle. For as I says in my \"Breakfast Ballad\"--\n\n 'If there's anythin' better than lyin' on leaves,\n It's risin' from leaves at dawnin',\n If there's anythin' better than sleepin' at eve,\n It's wakin' up in the mawnin'. 'If there's anythin' better than camp firelight,\n It's bright sunshine on wakin'. If there's anythin' better than puddin' at night,\n It's puddin' when day is breakin'. 'If there's anythin' better than singin' away\n While the stars are gaily shinin',\n Why, it's singin' a song at dawn of day,\n On puddin' for breakfast dinin'.'\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThere was a hearty round of applause at this song, for as Bunyip Bluegum\nremarked, 'Singing at breakfast should certainly be more commonly\nindulged in, as it greatly tends to enliven what is on most occasions a\nsomewhat dull proceeding.'\n\n'One of the great advantages of being a professional Puddin'-owner,'\nsaid Sam Sawnoff, 'is that songs at breakfast are always encouraged. None of the ordinary breakfast rules, such as scowling while eating, and\nsaying the porridge is as stiff as glue and the eggs are as tough as\nleather, are observed. Instead, songs, roars of laughter, and boisterous\njests are the order of the day. For example, this sort of thing,' added\nSam, doing a rapid back-flap and landing with a thump on Bill's head. As\nBill was unprepared for this act of boisterous humour, his face was\npushed into the Puddin' with great violence, and the gravy was splashed\nin his eye. [Illustration]\n\n'What d'yer mean, playin' such bungfoodlin' tricks on a man at\nbreakfast?' roared Bill. 'What d'yer mean,' shouted the Puddin', 'playing such foodbungling\ntricks on a Puddin' being breakfasted at?'\n\n'Breakfast humour, Bill, merely breakfast humour,' said Sam hastily. 'Humour's humour,' shouted Bill, 'but puddin' in the whiskers is no\njoke.'\n\n'Whiskers in the Puddin' is worse than puddin' in the whiskers,' shouted\nthe Puddin', standing up in his basin. 'Observe the rules, Bill,' said Sam hurriedly. 'Boisterous humour at the\nbreakfast table must be greeted with roars of laughter.'\n\n'To Jeredelum with the rules,' shouted Bill. 'Pushing a man's face into\nhis own breakfast is beyond rules or reason, and deserves a punch in the\ngizzard.'\n\nSeeing matters arriving at this unpromising situation, Bunyip Bluegum\ninterposed by saying, 'Rather than allow this happy occasion to be\nmarred by unseemly recriminations, let us, while admitting that our\nadmirable friend, Sam, may have unwittingly disturbed the composure of\nour admirable friend, Bill, at the expense of our admirable Puddin's\ngravy, let us, I say, by the simple act of extending the hand of\nfriendship, dispel in an instant these gathering clouds of disruption. In the words of the poem--\n\n 'Then let the fist of Friendship\n Be kept for Friendship's foes. Ne'er let that hand in anger land\n On Friendship's holy nose.'\n\nThese fine sentiments at once dispelled Bill's anger. He shook hands\nwarmly with Sam, wiped the gravy from his face, and resumed breakfast\nwith every appearance of hearty good humour. The meal over, the breakfast things were put away in the bag, Sam and\nBill took Puddin' between them, and all set off along the road,\nenlivening the way with song and story. Bill regaled them with portions\nof the 'Ballad of the _Salt Junk Sarah_', which is one of those songs\nthat go on for ever. Its great advantage, as Bill remarked, was that as\nit hadn't got an ending it didn't need a beginning, so you could start\nit anywhere. 'As for instance,' said Bill, and he roared out--\n\n 'Ho, aboard the _Salt Junk Sarah_,\n Rollin' home across the line,\n The Bo'sun collared the Captain's hat\n And threw it in the brine.",

'Now we shall have the awe-inspirin' spectacle of a\nfire to entertain us,' and, accosting the Fireman, he demanded to know\nwhere the fire was. 'The fact is,' said the Fireman, 'that owing to the size of this helmet\nI can't see where it is; but if you will kindly glance at the\nsurrounding district, you'll see it about somewhere.'\n\nThey glanced about and, sure enough, there was a fire burning in the\nnext field. It was only a cowshed, certainly, but it was blazing very\nnicely, and well worth looking at. 'Fire,' said Bill, 'in the form of a common cowshed, is burnin' about\nnor'-nor'-east as the crow flies.'\n\n'In that case,' said the Fireman, 'I invite all present bravely to\nassist in putting it out. But,' he added impressively, 'if you'll take\nmy advice, you'll shove that Puddin' in this hollow log and roll a\nstone agen the end to keep him in, for if he gets too near the flames\nhe'll be cooked again and have his flavour ruined.'\n\n[Illustration]\n\n'This is a very sensible feller,' said Bill, and though Puddin' objected\nstrongly, he was at once pushed into a log and securely fastened in with\na large stone. [Illustration]\n\n'How'd you like to be shoved in a blooming log,' he shouted at Bill,\n'when you was burning with anxiety to see the fire?' but Bill said\nseverely, 'Be sensible, Albert, fires is too dangerous to Puddin's\nflavours.'\n\nNo more time was lost in seizing the hose and they set off with the\ngreatest enthusiasm. For, as everyone knows, running with the reel is\none of the grand joys of being a fireman. They had the hose fixed to a\ngarden tap in no time, and soon were all hard at work, putting out the\nfire. [Illustration]\n\nOf course there was a great deal of smoke and shouting, and getting\ntripped up by the hose, and it was by the merest chance Bunyip Bluegum\nglanced back in time to see the Wombat in the act of stealing the\nPuddin' from the hollow log. 'Treachery is at work,' he shouted. 'Treachery,' roared Bill, and with one blow on the snout knocked the\nFireman endways on into the burning cinders, where his helmet fell off,\nand exposed the countenance of that snooting, snouting scoundrel, the\nPossum. The Possum, of course, hadn't expected to have his disguise pierced so\nswiftly, and, though he managed to scramble out of the fire in time to\nsave his bacon, he was considerably singed down the back. 'What a murderous attack!' he exclaimed. 'O, what a brutal attempt to\nburn a man alive!' and as some hot cinders had got down his back he gave\na sharp yell and ran off, singeing and smoking. Bill, distracted with\nrage, ran after the Possum, then changed his mind and ran after the\nWombat, so that, what with running first after one and then after the\nother, they both had time to get clean away, and disappeared over the\nskyline. 'I see it all,' shouted Bill, casting himself down in despair. 'Them low\npuddin'-thieves has borrowed a fireman's helmet, collared a hose, an'\nset fire to a cowshed in order to lure us away from the Puddin'.'\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n'The whole thing's a low put-up job on our noble credulity,' said Sam,\ncasting himself down beside Bill. 'It's one of the most frightful things that's ever happened,' said Bill. 'It's worse than treading on tacks with bare feet,' said Sam. 'It's worse than bein' caught stealin' fowls,' said Bill. 'It's worse than bein' stood on by cows,' said Sam. [Illustration]\n\n'It's almost as bad as havin' an uncle called Aldobrantifoscofornio,'\nsaid Bill, and they both sang loudly--\n\n 'It's worse than weevils, worse than warts,\n It's worse than corns to bear. It's worse than havin' several quarts\n Of treacle in your hair. 'It's worse than beetles in the soup,\n It's worse than crows to eat. It's worse than wearin' small-sized boots\n Upon your large-sized feet. 'It's worse than kerosene to boose,\n It's worse than ginger hair. It's worse than anythin' to lose\n A Puddin' rich and rare.'\n\n[Illustration]\n\nBunyip Bluegum reproved this despondency, saying, 'Come, come, this is\nno time for giving way to despair. Let us, rather, by the fortitude of\nour bearing prove ourselves superior to this misfortune and, with the\nenergy of justly enraged men, pursue these malefactors, who have so\nrichly deserved our vengeance. Arise!'\n\n'Bravely spoken,' said Bill, immediately recovering from despair. 'The grass is green, the day is fair,\n The dandelions abound.",

Arise!'\n\n'Bravely spoken,' said Bill, immediately recovering from despair. 'The grass is green, the day is fair,\n The dandelions abound. Is this a time for sad despair\n And sitting on the ground? 'Our Puddin' in some darksome lair\n In iron chains is bound,\n While puddin'-snatchers on him fare,\n And eat him by the pound. 'Let gloom give way to angry glare,\n Let weak despair be drowned,\n Let vengeance in its rage declare\n Our Puddin' must be found. 'Then let's resolve to do and dare. Let teeth with rage be ground. Let voices to the heavens declare\n Our Puddin' MUST be found.'\n\n'Those gallant words have fired our blood,' said Sam, and they both\nshook hands with Bunyip, to show that they were now prepared to follow\nthe call of vengeance. 'In order to investigate this dastardly outrage,' said Bunyip, 'we must\nbecome detectives, and find a clue. We must find somebody who has seen a\nsinged possum. Once traced to their lair, mother-wit will suggest some\nmeans of rescuing our Puddin'.'\n\nThey set off at once, and, after a brisk walk, came to a small house\nwith a signboard on it saying, 'Henderson Hedgehog, Horticulturist'. Henderson himself was in the garden, horticulturing a cabbage, and they\nasked him if he had chanced to see a singed possum that morning. 'What's that? What, what?' said Henderson Hedgehog, and when they had\nrepeated the question, he said, 'You must speak up, I'm a trifle deaf.'\n\n'Have you seen a singed possum?' shouted Bill. 'I can't hear you,' said Henderson. 'Have you seen a SINGED POSSUM?' roared Bill. 'To be sure,' said Henderson, 'but the turnips are backward.'\n\n'Turnips be stewed,' yelled Bill in such a tremendous voice that he blew\nhis own hat off. 'HAVE YOU SEEN A SINGED POSSUM?'\n\n'Good season for wattle blossom,' said Henderson. 'Well, yes, but a very\npoor season for carrots.'\n\n'A man might as well talk to a carrot as try an' get sense out of this\nrunt of a feller,' said Bill, disgusted. 'Come an' see if we can't find\nsomeone that it won't bust a man's vocal cords gettin' information out\nof.'\n\nThey left Henderson to his horticulturing and walked on till they met a\nParrot who was a Swagman, or a Swagman who was a Parrot. He must have\nbeen one or the other, if not both, for he had a bag and a swag, and a\nbeak, and a billy, and a thundering bad temper into the bargain, for the\nmoment Bill asked him if he had met a singed possum he shouted back--\n\n'Me eat a singed possum! I wouldn't eat a possum if he was singed,\nroasted, boiled, or fried.'\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n'Not ett--met,' shouted Bill. 'I said, met a singed possum.'\n\n'Why can't yer speak plainly, then,' said the Parrot. 'Have you got a\nfill of tobacco on yer?'\n\nHe took out his pipe and scowled at Bill. 'Here you are,' said Bill. 'Cut a fill an' answer the question.'\n\n'All in good time,' said the Parrot, and he added to Sam, 'You got any\ntobacco?'\n\nSam handed him a fill, and he put it in his pocket. 'You ain't got any\ntobacco,' he said scornfully to Bunyip Bluegum. 'I can see that at a\nglance. You're one of the non-smoking sort, all fur and feathers.'\n\n'Here,' said Bill angrily. 'Enough o' this beatin' about the bush. Answer the question.'\n\n'Don't be impatient,' said the Parrot. 'Have you got a bit o' tea an'\nsugar on yer?'\n\n'Here's yer tea an' sugar,' said Bill, handing a little of each out of\nthe bag. 'And that's the last thing you get. Now will you answer the\nquestion?'\n\n'Wot question?' asked the Parrot. 'Have yer seen a singed possum?' roared Bill. 'No, I haven't,' said the Parrot, and he actually had the insolence to\nlaugh in Bill's face. 'Of all the swivel-eyed, up-jumped, cross-grained, sons of a cock-eyed\ntinker,' exclaimed Bill, boiling with rage. 'If punching parrots on the\nbeak wasn't too painful for pleasure, I'd land you a sockdolager on the\nmuzzle that 'ud lay you out till Christmas. Come on, mates,' he added,\n'it's no use wastin' time over this low-down, hook-nosed\ntobacco-grabber.' And leaving the evil-minded Parrot to pursue his\nevil-minded way, they hurried off in search of information. The next person they spied was a Bandicoot carrying a watermelon. At a\nfirst glance you would have thought it was merely a watermelon walking\nby itself, but a second glance would have shown you that the walking was\nbeing done by a small pair of legs attached to the watermelon, and a\nthird glance would have disclosed that the legs were attached to a\nBandicoot. They shouted, 'Hi, you with the melon!' to attract his attention, and\nset off running after him, and the Bandicoot, being naturally of a\nterrified disposition, ran for all he was worth.",

He wasn't worth much as\na runner, owing to the weight of the watermelon, and they caught him up\nhalf-way across the field. [Illustration]\n\nConceiving that his hour had come, the Bandicoot gave a shrill squeak of\nterror and fell on his knees. 'Take me watermelon,' he gasped,'but spare me life.'\n\n'Stuff an' nonsense,' said Bill. 'We don't want your life. What we want\nis some information. Have you seen a singed possum about this morning?'\n\n'Singed possums, sir, yes sir, certainly sir,' gasped the Bandicoot,\ntrembling violently. 'What!' exclaimed Bill, 'do yer mean to say you have seen a singed\npossum?'\n\n'Singed possums, sir, yes sir,' gulped the Bandicoot. 'Very plentiful,\nsir, this time of the year, sir, owing to the bush fires, sir.'\n\n'Rubbish,' roared Bill. 'I don't believe he's seen a singed possum at\nall.'\n\n'No, sir,' quavered the Bandicoot. 'Certainly not, sir. Wouldn't think\nof seeing singed possums if there was any objection, sir.'\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n'You're a poltroon,' shouted Bill. 'You're a slaverin', quaverin',\nmelon-carryin' nincompoop. There's no more chance of getting information\nout of you than out of a terrified Turnip.'\n\nLeaving the Bandicoot to pursue his quavering, melon-humping existence,\nthey set off again, Bill giving way to some very despondent expressions. 'As far as I can see,' he said, 'if we can't find somethin' better than\nstone-deaf hedgehogs, peevish parrots, and funkin' bandicoots we may as\nwell give way to despair.'\n\nBunyip Bluegum was forced to exert his finest oratory to inspire them to\nanother frame of mind. 'Let it never be said,' he exclaimed, 'that the\nunconquerable hearts of Puddin'-owners quailed before a parrot, a\nhedgehog, or a bandicoot.'\n\n 'Let hedgehogs deaf go delve and dig,\n Immune from loudest howl,\n Let bandicoots lump melons big,\n Let peevish parrots prowl. 'Shall puddin'-owners bow the head\n At such affronts as these? No, No! March on, by anger led,\n Our Puddin' to release. 'Let courage high resolve inflame\n Our captive Pud to free;\n Our banner wave, our words proclaim\n We march to victory!'\n\n'Bravely sung,' exclaimed Bill, grasping Bunyip Bluegum by the hand, and\nthey proceeded with expressions of the greatest courage and\ndetermination. As a reward for this renewed activity, they got some useful information\nfrom a Rooster who was standing at his front gate looking up and down\nthe road, and wishing to heaven that somebody would come along for him\nto talk to. They got, in fact, a good deal more information than they\nasked for, for the Rooster was one of those fine up-standing, bumptious\nskites who love to talk all day, in the heartiest manner, to total\nstrangers while their wives do the washing. [Illustration]\n\n'Singed possum,' he exclaimed, when they had put the usual question to\nhim. 'Now, what an extraordinary thing that you should come along and\nask me that question. What an astounding and incredible thing that you\nshould actually use the word \"singed\" in connexion with the word\n\"possum\". Though mind you, the word I had in my mind was not \"singed\",\nbut \"burning\". And not \"possum\", but \"feathers\". Now, I'll tell you why. Only this morning, as I was standing here, I said to myself \"somebody's\nbeen burning feathers\". I called out at once to the wife--fine woman,\nthe wife, you'll meet her presently--\"Have you been burning feathers?\"\n\"No\", says she. \"Well,\" said I, \"if you haven't been burning feathers,\nsomebody else has.\" At the very moment that I'm repeating the words\n\"feathers\" and \"burning\" you come along and repeat the words \"singed\"\nand \"possum\". Instantly I call to mind that at the identical moment that\nI smelt something burning, I saw a possum passing this very gate, though\nwhether he happened to be singed or not I didn't inquire.'\n\n'Which way did he go?' inquired Bill excitedly. 'Now, let me see,' said the Rooster. 'He went down the road, turned to\nthe right, gave a jump and a howl, and set off in the direction of\nWatkin Wombat's summer residence.'\n\n'The very man we're after,' shouted Bill, and bolted off down the road,\nfollowed by the others, without taking any notice of the Rooster's\nrequest to wait a minute and be introduced to the wife. 'His wife may be all right,' said Bill as they ran, 'but what I say is,\nblow meetin' a bloomin' old Rooster's wife when you haven't got a year\nto waste listenin' to a bloomin' old Rooster.'\n\nThey followed the Rooster's directions with the utmost rapidity, and\ncame to a large hollow tree with a door in the side and a notice-board\nnailed up which said, 'Watkin Wombat, Esq., Summer Residence'.",

The door was locked, but it was clear that the puddin'-thieves were\ninside, because they heard the Possum say peevishly, 'You're eating too\nmuch, and here's me, most severely singed, not getting sufficient', and\nthe Wombat was heard to say, 'What you want is soap', but the Possum\nsaid angrily, 'What I need is immense quantities of puddin'.'\n\nThe avengers drew aside to hold a consultation. 'What's to be done?' said Bill. 'It's no use knockin', because they'd\nlook through the keyhole and refuse to come out, and, not bein'\nburglars, we can't bust the door in. It seems to me that there's nothin'\nfor it but to give way to despair.'\n\n[Illustration]\n\n'Never give way to despair while whiskers can be made from dry grass,'\nsaid Bunyip Bluegum, and suiting the action to the word, he swiftly made\na pair of fine moustaches out of dried grass and stuck them on with\nwattle gum. 'Now, lend me your hat,' he said to Bill, and taking the hat\nhe turned up the brim, dented in the top, and put it on. 'The bag is\nalso required,' he said to Sam, and taking that in his hand and turning\nhis coat inside out, he stood before them completely disguised. 'You two,' he said, 'must remain in hiding behind the tree. You will\nhear me knock, accost the ruffians and hold them in conversation. The\nmoment you hear me exclaim loudly, \"Hey, Presto! Pots and Pans\", you\nwill dart out and engage the villains at fisticuffs. The rest leave to\nme.'\n\n[Illustration]\n\nWaiting till the others were hidden behind the tree, Bunyip rapped\nsmartly on the door which opened presently and the Wombat put his head\nout cautiously. 'Have I the extreme pleasure of addressing Watkin Wombat, Esq.?'\ninquired Bunyip Bluegum, with a bow. Of course, seeing a perfect stranger at the door, the Wombat had no\nsuspicions, and said at once, 'Such is the name of him you see before\nyou.'\n\n'I have called to see you,' said Bunyip, 'on a matter of business. The\ncommodity which I vend is Pootles's Patent Pudding Enlarger, samples of\nwhich I have in the bag. As a guarantee of good faith we are giving\nsamples of our famous Enlarger away to all well-known Puddin'-owners. The Enlarger, one of the wonders of modern science, has but to be poured\nover the puddin', with certain necessary incantations, and the puddin'\nwill be instantly enlarged to double its normal size.' He took some\nsugar from the bag and held it up. 'I am now about to hand you some of\nthis wonderful discovery. But,' he added impressively, 'the operation of\nenlarging the puddin' is a delicate one, and must be performed in the\nopen air. Produce your puddin', and I will at once apply Pootles's\nPatent with marvellous effect.'\n\n'Of course it's understood that no charge is to be made,' said the\nPossum, hurrying out. 'No charge whatever,' said Bunyip Bluegum. So on the principle of always getting something for nothing, as the\nWombat said, Puddin' was brought out and placed on the ground. 'Now watch me closely,' said Bunyip Bluegum. He sprinkled the Puddin'\nwith sugar, made several passes with his hands, and pronounced these\nwords--\n\n[Illustration]\n\n 'Who incantations utters\n He generally mutters\n His gruesome blasts and bans\n But I, you need not doubt it,\n Prefer aloud to shout it,\n Hey, Presto! Pots and Pans.'\n\nOut sprang Bill and Sam and set about the puddin'-thieves like a pair of\nwindmills, giving them such a clip-clap clouting and a flip-flap\nflouting, that what with being punched and pounded, and clipped and\nclapped, they had only enough breath left to give two shrieks of despair\nwhile scrambling back into Watkin Wombat's Summer Residence, and banging\nthe door behind them. The three friends had Puddin' secured in no time,\nand shook hands all round, congratulating Bunyip Bluegum on the success\nof his plan. 'Your noble actin',' said Bill, 'has saved our Puddin's life.'\n\n'Them puddin'-thieves,' said Sam, 'was children in your hands.'\n\n'We hear you,' sang out the Possum, and the Wombat added, 'Oh, what\ndeceit!'\n\n'Enough of you two,' shouted Bill. 'If we catch you sneakin' after our\nPuddin' again, you'll get such a beltin' that you'll wish you was\nvegetarians. And now,' said he, 'for a glorious reunion round the camp\nfire.'\n\nAnd a glorious reunion they had, tucking into hot steak-and-kidney\npuddin' and boiled jam roll, which, after the exertions of the day, went\ndown, as Bill said, 'Grand'. 'If them puddin'-thieves ain't sufferin' the agonies of despair at this\nvery moment, I'll eat my hat along with the Puddin',' said Bill,\nexultantly. 'Indeed,' said Bunyip Bluegum, 'the consciousness that our enemies are\ndeservedly the victims of acute mental and physical anguish, imparts, it\nmust be admitted, an additional flavour to the admirable Puddin'.'\n\n'Well spoken,' said Bill, admiringly.",

The singing that evening was particularly loud and prolonged, owing to\nthe satisfaction they all felt at the recovery of their beloved Puddin'. The Puddin', who had got the sulks over Sam's remarks that fifteen goes\nof steak-and-kidney were enough for any self-respecting man, protested\nagainst the singing, which, he said, disturbed his gravy. '\"More eating\nand less noise\" is my motto,' he said, and he called Bill a\nleather-headed old barrel organ for reproving him. 'Albert is a spoilt child, I fear,' said Bill, shoving him into the bag\nto keep him quiet, and without more ado, led off with--\n\n[Illustration]\n\n 'Ho! aboard the _Salt Junk Sarah_,\n Rollin' home around the Horn,\n The Bo'sun pulls the Captain's nose\n For treatin' him with scorn. 'Rollin' home, rollin' home,\n Rollin' home across the foam. The Bo'sun goes with thumps and blows\n The whole way rollin' home.'\n\n'But,' said Bill to Bunyip Bluegum, after about fifteen verses of the\n_Salt Junk Sarah_, 'the superior skill, ingenuity and darin' with which\nyou bested them puddin'-snatchers reminds me of a similar incident in\nSam's youth, which I will now sing you. The incident, though similar as\nregards courage an' darin', is totally different in regard to everythin'\nelse, and is entitled--\n\n[Illustration]\n\nTHE PENGUIN'S BRIDE\n\n ''Twas on the _Saucy Soup Tureen_,\n That Sam was foremast hand,\n When on the quarter-deck was seen\n A maiding fit to be a Queen\n With her old Uncle stand. 'And Sam at once was sunk all\n In passion deep and grand,\n But this here aged Uncle\n He was the Hearl of Buncle\n And Sam a foremast hand. 'And Sam he chewed salt junk all\n Day with grief forlorn,\n Because the Hearl of Buncle,\n The lovely maiding's Uncle,\n Regarded him with scorn. 'When sailin' by Barbado,\n The _Saucy Soup Tureen_,\n Before she could be stayed-O\n Went down in a tornado,\n And never more was seen. [Illustration]\n\n 'The passengers were sunk all\n Beneath the ragin' wave,\n The maiding and her Uncle,\n The Noble Hearl of Buncle,\n Were saved by Sam the Brave. [Illustration]\n\n 'He saved the Noble Buncle\n By divin' off the poop. The maiding in a funk all\n He, saved along with Uncle\n Upon a chicken coop. 'And this here niece of Buncle,\n When they got safe to land,\n For havin' saved her Uncle,\n The Noble Hearl of Buncle,\n She offered Sam her hand. 'And that old Uncle Buncle,\n For joy of his release,\n On Burgundy got drunk all\n Day in Castle Buncle,\n Which hastened his decease. 'The lovely maiding Buncle\n Inherited the land;\n And, now her aged Uncle\n Has gone, the Hearl of Buncle\n Is Sam, the foremast hand.'\n\n[Illustration]\n\n'Of course,' said Sam modestly, 'the song goes too far in sayin' as how\nI married the Hearl's niece, because, for one thing, I ain't a marryin'\nman, and for another thing, what she really sez to me when we got to\nland was, \"You're a noble feller, an' here's five shillin's for you, and\nany time you happen to be round our way, just give a ring at the\nservants' bell, and there'll always be a feed waitin' for you in the\nkitchen.\" However, you've got to have songs to fill in the time with,\nand when a feller's got a rotten word like Buncle to find rhymes for,\nthere's no sayin' how a song'll end.'\n\n'The exigencies of rhyme,' said Bunyip Bluegum, 'may stand excused from\na too strict insistence on verisimilitude, so that the general gaiety is\nthereby promoted.

For what with low puddin'-thieves\ndisguising themselves as firemen, and low Wombats sneakin' our Puddin'\nwhile we're helpin' to put out fires, not to speak of all the worry and\nbother of tryin' to get information out of parrots and bandicoots an'\nhedgehogs, why, it's enough to make a man suspect his own grandfather of\nbein' a puddin'-snatcher.'\n\n'As for me,' said Sam Sawnoff, practising boxing attitudes as he walked\nalong, 'I feel like laying out the first man we meet on the off-chance\nof his being a puddin'-thief.'\n\n'Indeed,' observed Bunyip Bluegum, 'to have one's noblest feelings\noutraged by reposing a too great trust in unworthy people, is to end by\nregarding all humanity with an equal suspicion.'\n\n'If you ask my opinion,' said the Puddin' cynically, 'them\npuddin'-thieves are too clever for you; and, what's more, they're better\neaters than you. Why,' said the Puddin', sneering at Bill, 'I'll back\none puddin'-thief to eat more in a given time than three Puddin'-owners\nput together.'\n\n'These are very treacherous sentiments, Albert,' said Bill sternly. 'These are very ignoble and shameless words,' but the Puddin' merely\nlaughed scornfully, and called Bill a bun-headed old beetle-crusher. 'Very well,' said Bill, enraged, 'we shall see if a low puddin'-thief is\nbetter than a noble Puddin'-owner. When you see the terrible suspicions\nI shall indulge in to-day you'll regret them words.'\n\nTo prove his words Bill insisted on closely inspecting everybody he met,\nin case they should be puddin'-thieves in disguise. To start off with, they had an unpleasant scene with a Kookaburra, a low\nlarrikin who resented the way that Bill examined him. 'Who are you starin' at, Poodle's Whiskers?' he asked. [Illustration]\n\n'Never mind,' said Bill. 'I'm starin' at you for a good an' sufficient\nreason.'\n\n'Are yer?' said the Kookaburra. 'Well, all I can say is that if yer\ndon't take yer dial outer the road I'll bloomin' well take an' bounce a\ngibber off yer crust,' and he followed them for quite a long way,\nsinging out insulting things such as, 'You with the wire whiskers,' and\n'Get onter the bloke with the face fringe.'\n\nBill, of course, treated this conduct with silent contempt. It was his\nrule through life, he said, never to fight people with beaks. The next encounter they had was with a Flying-fox who, though not so\nvulgar and rude as the Kookaburra, was equally enraged because, as Bill\nhad suspicions that he was the Possum disguised, he insisted on\nmeasuring him to see if he was the same length. 'Nice goings on, indeed,' said the Flying-fox, while Bill was measuring\nhim, 'if a man can't go about his business without being measured by\ntotal strangers. A nice thing, indeed, to happen to Finglebury\nFlying-fox, the well-known and respected fruit stealer.'\n\nHowever, he was found to be six inches too short, so they let him go,\nand he hurried off, saying, 'I shall have the Law on you for this,\nmeasuring a man in a public place without being licensed as a tailor.'\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe third disturbance due to Bill's suspicions occurred while Bunyip\nBluegum was in a grocer's shop. They had run out of tea and sugar, and\nhappening to pass through the town of Bungledoo took the opportunity of\nlaying in a fresh supply. If Bunyip hadn't been in the shop, as was\npointed out afterwards, the trouble wouldn't have occurred. The first he\nheard of it was a scream of 'Help, help, murder is being done!' and\nrushing out of the shop, what was his amazement to see no less a person\nthan his Uncle Wattleberry bounding and plunging about the road with\nBill hanging on to his whiskers, and Sam hanging on to one leg. [Illustration]\n\n'I've got him,' shouted Bill. 'Catch a hold of his other leg and give me\na chance to get his whiskers off.'\n\n'But why are you taking his whiskers off?' inquired Bunyip Bluegum. [Illustration]\n\n'Because they're stuck on with glue,' shouted Bill. 'I saw it at a\nglance. It's Watkin Wombat, Esq., disguised as a company promoter.'\n\n'Dear me,' said Bunyip, hurriedly, 'you are making a mistake. This is\nnot a puddin'-thief, this is an Uncle.'\n\n'A what?' exclaimed Bill, letting go the whiskers. 'An Uncle,' replied Bunyip Bluegum. 'An Uncle,' roared Uncle Wattleberry. 'An Uncle of the highest\nintegrity. You have most disgracefully and unmercifully pulled an\nUncle's whiskers.'\n\n'I can assure you,' said Bill, 'I pulled them under the delusion that\nyou was a disguised Wombat.'\n\n'That is no excuse, sir,' bellowed Uncle Wattleberry. 'No one but an\nunmitigated ruffian would pull an Uncle's whiskers. 'Who but the basest scoundrel, double-eyed,\n Would pluck an Uncle's whiskers in their pride,\n What baseness, then, doth such a man disclose\n Who'd raise a hand to pluck an Uncle's nose?'\n\n'If I've gone too far,' said Bill, 'I apologize. If I'd known you was an\nUncle I wouldn't have done it.'\n\n'Apologies are totally inadequate,' shouted Uncle Wattleberry.",

'Nothing\nshort of felling you to the earth with an umbrella could possibly atone\nfor the outrage. You are a danger to the whisker-growing public. You\nhave knocked my hat off, pulled my whiskers, and tried to remove my\nnose.'\n\n'Pullin' your nose,' said Bill, solemnly, 'is a mistake any man might\nmake, for I put it to all present, as man to man, if that nose don't\nlook as if it's only gummed on.'\n\nAll present were forced to admit that it was a mistake that any man\nmight make. 'Any man,' as Sam remarked, 'would think he was doing you a\nkindness by trying to pull it off.'\n\n'Allow me to point out also, my dear Uncle,' said Bunyip Bluegum, 'that\nyour whiskers were responsible for this seeming outrage. Let your anger,\nthen, be assuaged by the consciousness that you are the victim, not of\nmalice, but of the misfortune of wearing whiskers.'\n\n'How now,' exclaimed Uncle Wattleberry. 'My nephew Bunyip among these\nsacrilegious whisker-pluckers and nose-pullers. My nephew, not only\naiding and abetting these ruffians, but seeking to palliate their\ncrimes! This is too much. My feelings are such that nothing but bounding\nand plunging can relieve them.'\n\nAnd thereupon did Uncle Wattleberry proceed to bound and plunge with the\ngreatest activity, shouting all the while--\n\n 'You need not think I bound and plunge\n Like this in festive mood. I bound that bounding may expunge\n The thought of insult rude. 'An Uncle's rage must seek relief,\n His anger must be drowned;\n It is to soothe an Uncle's grief\n That thus I plunge and bound. 'I bound and plunge, I seethe with rage,\n My mighty anger seeks\n So much relief that I engage\n To plunge and bound for weeks.'\n\nSeeing that there was no possibility of inducing Uncle Wattleberry to\nlook at the affair in a reasonable light, they walked off and left him\nto continue his bounding and plunging for the amusement of the people of\nBungledoo, who brought their chairs out on to the footpath in order to\nenjoy the sight at their ease. Bill's intention to regard everybody he\nmet with suspicion was somewhat damped by this mistake, and he said\nthere ought to be a law to prevent a man going about looking as if he\nwas a disguised puddin'-thief. The most annoying part of it all was that when the puddin'-thieves did\nmake their appearance they weren't disguised at all. They were dressed\nas common ordinary puddin'-thieves, save that the Possum carried a bran\nbag in his hand and the Wombat waved a white flag. [Illustration]\n\n'Well, if this isn't too bad,' shouted Bill, enraged. 'What d'you mean,\ncomin' along in this unexpected way without bein' disguised?'\n\n'No, no,' sang out the Possum. 'No disguises to-day.'\n\n'No fighting, either,' said the Wombat. 'No disguises, no fighting, and no puddin'-stealing,' said the Possum. 'Nothing but the fairest and most honourable dealings.'\n\n[Illustration]\n\n'If you ain't after our Puddin', what are you after?' demanded Bill. 'We're after bringing you a present in this bag,' said the Possum. 'Absurd,' said Bill. 'Puddin'-thieves don't give presents away.'\n\n'Don't say that, Bill,' said the Possum, solemnly. 'If you only knew\nwhat noble intentions we have, you'd be ashamed of them words.'\n\n[Illustration]\n\n'You'd blush to hear your voice a-utterin' of them,' said the Wombat. 'I can't make this out at all,' said Bill, scratching his head. 'The\nidea of a puddin'-thief offering a man a present dumbfounds me, as the\nsaying goes.'\n\n'No harm is intended,' said the Possum, and the Wombat added: 'Harm is\nas far from our thoughts as from the thoughts of angels.'\n\n'Well, well,' said Bill, at length. 'I'll just glance at it first, to\nsee what it's like.'\n\nBut the Possum shook his head. 'No, no, Bill,' he said, 'no glancing,'\nand the Wombat added: 'To prove that no deception is intended, all heads\nmust look in the bag together.'\n\n'What's to be done about this astoundin' predicament?' said Bill. 'If\nthere is a present, of course we may as well have it. If there ain't a\npresent, of course we shall simply have to punch their snouts as\nusual.'\n\n'One must confess,' said Bunyip Bluegum, 'to the prompting of a certain\ncuriosity as to the nature of this present'; and Sam added, 'Anyway,\nthere's no harm in having a look at it.'\n\n'No harm whatever,' said the Possum, and he held the bag open\ninvitingly. The Puddin'-owners hesitated a moment, but the temptation\nwas too strong, and they all looked in together. It was a fatal act. The\nPossum whipped the bag over their heads, the Wombat whipped a rope round\nthe bag, and there they were, helpless. [Illustration]\n\nThe worst of it was that the Puddin', being too short to look in, was\nleft outside, and the puddin'-thieves grabbed him at once and ran off\nlike winking.",

To add to the Puddin'-owners' discomfiture there was a\nconsiderable amount of bran in the bag; and, as Bill said afterwards,\n'if there's anything worse than losing a valuable Puddin', it's bran in\nthe whiskers'. They bounded and plunged about, but soon had to stop that\non account of treading on each other's toes--especially Sam's, who\nendured agonies, having no boots on. [Illustration]\n\n'What a frightful calamity,' groaned Bill giving way to despair. 'It's worse than being chased by natives on the Limpopo River,' said\nSam. 'It's worse than fighting Arabs single-handed,' croaked Bill. 'It's almost as bad as being pecked on the head by eagles,' said Sam,\nand in despair they sang in muffled tones--\n\n 'O what a fearful fate it is,\n O what a frightful fag,\n To have to walk about like this\n All tied up in a bag. 'Our noble confidence has sent\n Us on this fearful jag;\n In noble confidence we bent\n To look inside this bag. 'Deprived of air, in dark despair\n Upon our way we drag;\n Condemned for evermore to wear\n This frightful, fearsome bag.'\n\nBunyip Bluegum reproved this faint-heartedness, saying, 'As our\nmisfortunes are due to exhibiting too great a trust in scoundrels, so\nlet us bear them with the greater fortitude. As in innocence we fell, so\nlet our conduct in this hour of dire extremity be guided by the\ncourageous endurance of men whose consciences are free from guilt.'\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThese fine words greatly stimulated the others, and they endured with\nfortitude, walking on Sam's feet for an hour and a half, when the sound\nof footsteps apprised them that a traveller was approaching. This traveller was a grave, elderly dog named Benjimen Brandysnap, who\nwas going to market with eggs. Seeing three people walking in a bag he\nnaturally supposed they were practising for the sports, but on hearing\ntheir appeals for help he very kindly undid the rope. 'Preserver,' exclaimed Bill, grasping him by the hand. 'Noble being,' said Sam. 'Guardian angel of oppressed Puddin'-owners,' said Bunyip Bluegum. Benjimen was quite overcome by these expressions of esteem, and handed\nround eggs, which were eaten on the spot. 'And now,' said Bill, again shaking hands with their preserver, 'I am\nabout to ask you a most important question. Have you seen any\npuddin'-thieves about this mornin'?'\n\n'Puddin'-thieves,' said Benjimen. 'Let me see. Now that you mention it,\nI remember seeing two puddin'-thieves at nine-thirty this morning. But\nthey weren't stealing puddin's. They were engaged stealing a bag out of\nmy stable. I was busy at the time whistling to the carrots, or I'd have\nstopped them.'\n\n'This is most important information,' said Bill. 'It proves this must be\nthe very bag they stole. In what direction did the scoundrels go,\nfriend, after stealing your bag?'\n\n'As I was engaged at the moment feeding the parsnips, I didn't happen to\nnotice,' said Benjimen. 'But at this season puddin'-thieves generally go\nsouth-east, owing to the price of onions.'\n\n'In that case,' said Bill, 'we shall take a course north-west, for it's\nmy belief that havin' stolen our Puddin' they'll make back to winter\nquarters.'\n\n'We will pursue to the north-west with the utmost vigour,' said Bunyip. 'Swearin' never to give in till revenge has been inflicted and our\nPuddin' restored to us,' said Bill. 'In order to exacerbate our just anger,' said Bunyip Bluegum, 'let us\nsing as we go--\n\nTHE PUDDIN'-OWNERS' QUEST\n\n 'On a terrible quest we run north-west,\n In a terrible rage we run;\n With never a rest we run north-west\n Till our terrible work is done. Without delay\n Away, away,\n In a terrible rage we run all day. 'By our terrible zest you've doubtless guessed\n That vengeance is our work;\n For we seek the nest with terrible zest\n Where the puddin'-snatchers lurk. With rage, with gloom,\n With fret and fume,\n We seek the puddin'-snatchers' doom.'\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThey ran north-west for two hours without seeing a sign of the\npuddin'-thieves. Benjimen ran with them to exact revenge for the theft\nof his bag. It was hot work running, and having no Puddin' they couldn't\nhave lunch, but Benjimen very generously handed eggs all round again. 'Eggs is all very well,' said Bill, eating them in despair, 'but they\ndon't come up to Puddin' as a regular diet, and all I can say is, that\nif that Puddin' ain't restored soon I shall go mad with grief.'\n\n'I shall go mad with rage,' said Sam, and they both sang loudly--\n\n 'Go mad with grief or mad with rage,\n It doesn't matter whether;\n Our Puddin's left this earthly stage,\n So in despair we must engage\n To both go mad together.'\n\n'I have a suggestion to make,' said Bunyip Bluegum, 'which will at once\nrestore your wonted good-humour.",

Observe me.'\n\nHe looked about till he found a piece of board, and wrote this notice on\nit with his fountain pen--\n\n A GRAND PROCESSION OF\n THE AMALGAMATED SOCIETY OF\n PUDDINGS WILL PASS HERE\n AT 2.30 TO-DAY\n\nThis he hung on a tree. 'Now,' said he, 'all that remains to be done is\nto hide behind this bush. The news of the procession will spread like\nwildfire through the district, and the puddin'-thieves, unable to resist\nsuch a spectacle, will come hurrying to view the procession. The rest\nwill be simply a matter of springing out on them like lions.'\n\n'Superbly reasoned,' said Bill, grasping Bunyip by the hand. [Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThey all hid behind the bush and a crow, who happened to be passing,\nread the sign and flew off at once to spread the news through the\ndistrict. In fifteen minutes, by Bill's watch, the puddin'-thieves came running\ndown the road, and took up a position on a stump to watch the\nprocession. They had evidently been disturbed in the very act of eating\nPuddin', for the Possum was still masticating a mouthful; and the Wombat\nhad stuck the Puddin' in his hat, and put his hat on his head, which\nclearly proved him to be a very ill-bred fellow, for in good society\nwearing puddin's on the head is hardly ever done. [Illustration]\n\nBill and Sam, who were like bloodhounds straining at the leash, sprang\nout and confronted the scoundrels, while Bunyip and Ben got behind in\norder to cut off their retreat. 'We've got you at last,' said Bill, sparring up at the Possum with the\nfiercest activity. 'Out with our Puddin', or prepare for a punch on the\nsnout.'\n\nThe Possum turned pale and the Wombat hastily got behind him. 'Puddin',' said the Possum, acting amazement. 'What strange request is\nthis?'\n\n'What means this strange request?' asked the Wombat. 'No bungfoodlin',' said Bill sternly. 'Produce the Puddin' or prepare\nfor death.'\n\n[Illustration]\n\n'Before bringing accusations,' said the Possum, 'prove where the Puddin'\nis.'\n\n'It's under that feller's hat,' roared Bill, pointing at the Wombat. 'Prove it,' said the Wombat. 'You can't wear hats that high, without there's puddin's under them,'\nsaid Bill. 'That's not puddin's,' said the Possum; 'that's ventilation. He wears\nhis hat like that to keep his brain cool.'\n\n'Very well,' said Bill. 'I call on Ben Brandysnap, as an independent\nwitness whose bag has been stolen, to prove what's under that hat.'\n\nBen put on his spectacles in order to study the Wombat carefully, and\ngravely pronounced this judgement--\n\n 'When you see a hat\n Stuck up like that\n You remark with some surprise,\n \"Has he been to a shop,\n And bought for his top\n A hat of the largest size?\"\n\n 'Or else you say,\n As you note the way\n He wears it like a wreath,\n \"It cannot be fat\n That bulges his hat;\n He's got something underneath.\"\n\n 'But whether or not\n It's a Puddin' he's got\n Can only be settled by lifting his pot. Or by taking a stick,\n A stone or a brick,\n And hitting him hard on the head with it quick. If he yells, you hit fat,\n If he doesn't, well that\n Will prove it's a Puddin' that's under his hat.'\n\n'Now are you satisfied?' asked Bill, and they all shouted--\n\n 'Hurrah! hurray! Just listen to that;\n He knows the way\n To bell the cat. You'd better obey\n His judgement pat,\n\n 'Without delay\n Remove the hat;\n It's tit-for-tat,\n We tell you flat,\n You'll find it pay\n To lift your hat. 'Obey the mandate of our chosen lawyer,\n Remove that hat, or else we'll do it faw yer.'\n\n'No, no,' said the Possum, shaking his head. 'No removing people's hats. Removing hats is larceny, and you'll get six months for it.'\n\n'No bashing heads, either,' said the Wombat. 'That's manslaughter, and\nwe'll have you hung for it.'\n\nBill scratched his head. 'This is an unforeseen predicament,' he said. 'Just mind them puddin'-thieves a minute, Ben, while we has a word in\nprivate.' He took Sam and Bunyip aside, and almost gave way to despair. 'What a frightful situation,' wailed he. 'We can't unlawfully take a\npuddin'-thief's hat off, and while it remains on who's to prove our\nPuddin's under it? This is one of the worst things that's happened to\nSam and me for years.'\n\n'It's worse than being chased by wart-hogs,' said Sam. 'It's worse than rolling off a cowshed,' said Bill. 'It's worse than wearing soup tureens for hats,' said Sam. 'It's almost as bad as swallowing thistle buttons,' said Bill, and both\nsang loudly--\n\n 'It's worse than running in a fright,\n Pursued by Polar bears;\n It's worse than being caught at night\n By lions in their lairs.",

This is one of the worst things that's happened to\nSam and me for years.'\n\n'It's worse than being chased by wart-hogs,' said Sam. 'It's worse than rolling off a cowshed,' said Bill. 'It's worse than wearing soup tureens for hats,' said Sam. 'It's almost as bad as swallowing thistle buttons,' said Bill, and both\nsang loudly--\n\n 'It's worse than running in a fright,\n Pursued by Polar bears;\n It's worse than being caught at night\n By lions in their lairs. 'It's worse than barrel organs when\n They play from night till morn;\n It's worse than having large-sized men\n A-standing on your corn. 'It's worse than when at midnight you\n Tread on a silent cat,\n To have a puddin'-snatcher who\n Will not remove his hat.'\n\n'All is not yet lost,' said Bunyip Bluegum. 'Without reverting to\nviolent measures, I will engage to have the hat removed.'\n\n'You will?' exclaimed Bill, grasping Bunyip by the hand. 'I will,' said Bunyip firmly. 'All I ask is that you strike a dignified\nattitude in the presence of these scoundrels, and, at a given word,\nfollow my example.'\n\nThey all struck a dignified attitude in front of the puddin'-thieves,\nand Bunyip Bluegum, raising his hat, struck up the National Anthem, the\nothers joining in with superb effect. 'Hats off in honour to our King,' shouted Bill, and off came all the\nhats. The puddin'-thieves, of course, were helpless. The Wombat had to\ntake his hat off, or prove himself disloyal, and there was Puddin'\nsitting on his head. [Illustration]\n\n'Now who's a liar?' shouted Bill, hitting the Possum a swinging blow on\nthe snout, while Sam gave the Wombat one of his famous over-arm flip\nflaps that knocked all the wind out of him. The Wombat tried to escape\npunishment by shouting, 'Never strike a man with a Puddin' on his head';\nbut, now that their guilt was proved, Bill and Sam were utterly\nremorseless, and gave the puddin'-thieves such a trouncing that their\nshrieks pierced the firmament. When this had been done, all hands gave\nthem an extra thumping in the interests of common morality. Eggs were\nrubbed in their hair by Benjimen, and Bill and Sam attended to the\nbeating and snout-bending, while Bunyip did the reciting. Standing on a\nstump, he declaimed--\n\n[Illustration]\n\n 'The blows you feel we do not deal\n In common, vulgar thumping;\n To higher motives we appeal--\n It is to teach you not to steal,\n Your head we now are bumping. You need not go on pumping\n Appeals for kinder dealing,\n We like to watch you jumping,\n We like to hear you squealing. We rather think this thumping\n Will take a bit of healing. We hope these blows upon the nose,\n These bended snouts, these tramped-on toes,\n These pains that you are feeling\n The truth will be revealing\n How wrong is puddin'-stealing.'\n\nThen, with great solemnity, he recited the following fine moral lesson--\n\n[Illustration]\n\n 'A puddin'-thief, as I've heard tell,\n Quite lost to noble feeling,\n Spent all his days, and nights as well,\n In constant puddin'-stealing. 'He stole them here, he stole them there,\n He knew no moderation;\n He stole the coarse, he stole the rare,\n He stole without cessation. [Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n 'He stole the steak-and-kidney stew\n That housewives in a rage hid;\n He stole the infant's Puddin' too,\n The Puddin' of the aged. 'He lived that Puddin's he might lure,\n Into his clutches stealthy;\n He stole the Puddin' of the poor,\n The Puddin' of the wealthy. 'This evil wight went forth one night\n Intent on puddin'-stealing,\n When he beheld a hidden light\n A secret room revealing. 'Within he saw a fearful man,\n With eyes like coals a-glowing,\n Whose frightful whiskers over-ran\n His face, like weeds a-blowing;\n\n 'And there this fearful, frightful man,\n A sight to set you quaking,\n With pot and pan and curse and ban,\n Began a Puddin' making. [Illustration]\n\n ''Twas made of buns and boiling oil,\n A carrot and some nails-O! A lobster's claws, the knobs off doors,\n An onion and some snails-O! 'A pound of fat, an old man rat,\n A pint of kerosene-O! A box of tacks, some cobbler's wax,\n Some gum and glycerine-O! 'Gunpowder too, a hob-nailed shoe,\n He stirred into his pottage;\n Some Irish stew, a pound of glue,\n A high explosive sausage. 'The deed was done, that frightful one,\n With glare of vulture famished,\n Blew out the light, and in the night\n Gave several howls, and vanished. 'Our thieving lout, ensconced without,\n Came through the window slinking;\n He grabbed the pot and on the spot\n Began to eat like winking. 'He ate the lot, this guzzling sot--\n Such appetite amazes--\n Until those high explosives wrought\n Within his tum a loud report,\n And blew him all to blazes. 'For him who steals ill-gotten meals\n Our moral is a good un. We hope he feels that it reveals\n The danger he is stood in\n Who steals a high explosive bomb,\n Mistaking it for Puddin'.'\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe puddin'-thieves wept loudly while this severe rebuke was being\nadministered, and promised, with sobs, to amend their evil courses, and\nin the future to abstain from unlawful puddin'-snatching.",

'Your words,' said the Possum, 'has pierced our brains with horror and\nremorse'; and the Wombat added: 'From this time onwards our thoughts\nwill be as far removed from Puddin' as is the thoughts of angels.'\n\n'We have heard that before,' said Bunyip Bluegum; 'but let us hope that\nthis time your repentance is sincere. Let us hope that the tenderness of\nyour snouts will be, if I may be permitted a flight of poetic fancy, a\nguiding star to lure your steps along the path of virtue--\n\n 'For he who finds his evil course is ended\n By having of his snout severely bended,\n Along that path of virtue may be sent\n Where virtuous snouts are seldom ever bent.'\n\nWith that the puddin'-thieves went over the hill, the sun went down and\nevening arrived, punctual to the minute. 'Ah,' said Bill. 'It's a very fortunate thing that evenin's come along\nat this time, for, if it hadn't, we couldn't have waited dinner any\nlonger. But, before preparin' for a night of gaiety, dance, and song, I\nhave a proposal to put before my feller Puddin'-owners. I propose to\ninvite our friend Ben here to join us round the camp fire. He has proved\nhimself a very decent feller, free with his eggs, and as full of revenge\nagainst puddin'-thieves as ourselves.'\n\n'Hospitably spoken,' said Bunyip Bluegum, and the Puddin'-owners sang--\n\n 'Come join us we intreat,\n Come join us we implore,\n In Friendship's name our guest we claim,\n And Friendship's name is law. 'We've Puddin' here a treat,\n We've Puddin' here galore;\n Do not decline to stay and dine,\n Our Puddin' you'll adore. 'Our Puddin', we repeat,\n You really cannot beat,\n And here are we its owners three\n Who graciously intreat\n You'll be at our request,\n The Puddin'-owners' guest.'\n\n'For these sentiments of esteem, admiration, and respect,' said Ben, 'I\nthank you. As one market-gardener to three Puddin'-owners, I may say I\nwouldn't wish to eat the Puddin' of three finer fellers than\nyourselves.'\n\nWith this cordial understanding they set about preparing the camp fire,\nand the heartiest expressions of friendship were indulged in while the\nPuddin' was being passed round. As Bunyip aptly remarked--\n\n 'All Fortune's buffets he can surely pardon her,\n Who claims as guest our courteous Market Gardener.'\n\nTo which Benjimen handsomely replied--\n\n 'Still happier he, who meets three Puddin'-owners,\n Whose Puddin' is the equal of its donors.'\n\nAnd, indeed, a very pleasant evening they had round the camp fire. Fourth Slice\n\n'This is what I call satisfactory,' said Bill, as they sat at breakfast\nnext morning. 'It's a great relief to the mind to know that them\npuddin'-thieves is sufferin' the agonies of remorse, and that our\nPuddin' is safe from bein' stolen every ten minutes.'\n\n'You're a bun-headed old optimist,' said the Puddin' rudely. 'Puddin'-thieves never suffer from remorse. They only suffer from\nblighted hopes and suppressed activity.'\n\n'Have you no trust in human nature, Albert?' asked Bill, sternly. 'Don't\nyou know that nothin' gives a man greater remorse than havin' his face\npunched, his toes trod on, and eggs rubbed in his hair?'\n\n'I have grave doubts myself,' said Bunyip Bluegum, 'as to the sincerity\nof their repentance'; and Ben Brandysnap said that, speaking as a market\ngardener, his experience of carrot catchers, onion snatchers, pumpkin\npouncers, and cabbage grabbers induced him to hold the opinion that\nshooting them with pea-rifles was the only sure way to make them feel\nremorse. In fact, as Sam said--\n\n 'The howls and groans of pain and grief,\n The accents of remorse,\n Extracted from a puddin'-thief\n Are all put on, of course.'\n\n'Then, all I can say is,' cried Bill, enraged, 'if there's any more of\nthis business of puddin'-thieves, disguised as firemen, stealing our\nPuddin', and puddin'-thieves, not disguised at all, shovin' bags over\nour heads, blow me if I don't give up Puddin'-owning in despair and take\nto keepin' carrots for a livin'.'\n\nThe Puddin' was so furious at this remark that they were forced to eat\nan extra slice all round to pacify him, in spite of which he called Bill\na turnip-headed old carrot-cruncher, and other insulting names. However,\nat length they set out on the road, Bill continuing to air some very\ndespondent remarks. 'For what is the good of havin' a noble trustin' nature,' said he, 'for\nevery low puddin'-thief in the land to take advantage of? As far as I\ncan see, the only thing to do is to punch every snout we meet, and\nchance the odds it belongs to a puddin'-thief.'\n\n'Come,' said Bunyip Bluegum, 'I see you are not your wonted,\ngood-humoured self this morning.",

As a means of promoting the general\ngaiety, I call on you to sing the _Salt Junk Sarah_ without delay.'\n\nThis was immediately effective, and Bill with the greatest heartiness\nroared out--\n\n 'Ho, aboard the _Salt Junk Sarah_\n Rollin' round the ocean wide,\n The bo'sun's mate, I grieve to state,\n He kissed the bo'sun's bride. [Illustration]\n\n 'Rollin' home, rollin' home,\n Home across the foam;\n The bo'sun rose and punched his nose\n And banged him on the dome.'\n\nAt about the fifteenth verse they came to the town of Tooraloo, and that\nput a stop to the singing, because you can't sing in the public streets\nunless you are a musician or a nuisance. The town of Tooraloo is one of\nthose dozing, snoozing, sausage-shaped places where all the people who\naren't asleep are only half awake, and where dogs pass away their lives\non the footpaths, and you fall over cows when taking your evening\nstroll. [Illustration]\n\nThere was a surprise awaiting them at Tooraloo, for the moment they\narrived two persons in bell-toppers and long-tailed coats ran out from\nbehind a fence and fell flat on their backs in the middle of the road,\nyelling 'Help, help! thieves and ruffians are at work!'\n\nThe travellers naturally stared with amazement at this peculiar\nconduct. The moment the persons in bell-toppers caught sight of them\nthey sprang up, and striking an attitude expressive of horror, shouted:\n\n'Behold the puddin'-thieves!'\n\n[Illustration]\n\n'Behold the what?' exclaimed Bill. 'Puddin'-thieves,' said one of the bell-topperers. 'For well you know\nthat that dear Puddin' in your hand has been stolen from its parents and\nguardians, which is ourselves.' And the other bell-topperer added, 'Deny\nit not, for with that dear Puddin' in your hand your guilt is manifest.'\n\n'Well, if this ain't enough to dumbfound a codfish,' exclaimed Bill. 'Here's two total strangers, disguised as undertakers, actually accusin'\nus of stealin' our own Puddin'. Why, it's outside the bounds of\ncomprehension!'\n\n'It's enough to stagger the senses,' said Sam. 'It's enough to daze the mind with horror,' said Bill. 'Come, come,' said the bell-topperers, 'cease these expressions of\namazement and hand over the stolen Puddin'.'\n\n'What d'yer mean,' exclaimed Bill, 'by calling this a stolen Puddin'? It's a respectable steak-and-kidney, apple-dumplin', grand digestive\nPuddin', and any fellers in pot-hats sayin' it's a stolen Puddin' is\nscoundrels of the deepest dye.'\n\n'Never use such words to people wearing bell-toppers,' said one of the\nbell-topperers, and the other added, 'With that dear Puddin' gazing up\nto heaven, how can you use such words?'\n\n'All very fine, no doubt,' sneered Bill, 'but if you ain't scoundrels of\nthe deepest dye, remove them hats and prove you ain't afraid to look us\nin the eye.'\n\n'No, no,' said the first bell-topperer. 'No removing hats at present on\naccount of sunstroke, and colds in the head, and doctor's orders. My\ndoctor said to me only this morning, \"Never remove your hat.\" Those were\nhis words. \"Let it be your rule through life,\" he said, \"to keep the\nhead warm, whatever happens.\"'\n\n'No singing \"God save the King\", neither,' said the other bell-topperer. 'Let your conduct be noble, and never sing the National Anthem to people\nwearing bell-toppers.'\n\n'In fact,' said the first bell-topperer, 'all we say is, hand over the\nPuddin' with a few well-chosen words, and all ill-feeling will be\ndropped.'\n\nBill was so enraged at this suggestion that he dashed his hat on the\nground and kicked it to relieve his feelings. 'Law or no law,' he\nshouted, 'I call on all hands to knock them bell-toppers off.'\n\nAll hands made a rush for the bell-topperers, who shouted, 'An\nEnglishman's hat is his castle,' and Top-hats are sacred things'; but\nthey were overpowered by numbers, and their hats were snatched off. 'THE\nPUDDIN'-THIEVES!' shouted the company. Those bell-toppers had disguised that snooting, snouting scoundrel, the\nPossum, and his snoozing, boozing friend the Wombat! There was an\nimmense uproar over this discovery, Bill and Sam flapping and\nsnout-bending away at the puddin'-thieves, the puddin'-thieves roaring\nfor mercy. Ben denounced them as bag snatchers, and Bunyip Bluegum\nexpressed his indignation in a fine burst of oratory, beginning:\n\n'Base, indeed, must be those scoundrels, who, lost to all sense of\ndecency and honour, boldly assume the outward semblance of worthy\ncitizens, and, by the pretentious nature of their appearance, not only\nseek the better to impose upon the noble credulity of Puddin'-owners,\nbut, with dastardly cunning, strike a blow at Society's most sacred\nemblem--the pot-hat.'\n\nThe uproar brought the Mayor of Tooraloo hastening to the scene,\nfollowed by the local constable.",

The Mayor was a little, fat,\nbreathless, beetle-shaped man, who hastened with difficulty owing to his\nrobe of office being trodden on by the Constable, who ran close behind\nhim in order to finish eating a banana in secret. He had some more\nbananas in a paper bag, and his face was one of those feeble faces that\nmake one think of eggs and carrots and feathers, if you take my meaning. 'How now, how now!' shouted the Mayor. 'A riot going on here, a\ndisturbance in the town of Tooraloo. Constable, arrest these rioters and\ndisturbers.'\n\n'Before going to extremes,' said the Constable, in a tremulous voice,\n'my advice to you is, read the Riot Act, and so have all the honour and\nglory of stopping the riot yourself.'\n\n[Illustration]\n\n'Unfortunately,' said the Mayor, 'in the haste of departure, I forgot to\nbring the Riot Act, so there's nothing else for it; you must have all\nthe honour and glory of quelling it.'\n\n'The trouble is,' said the Constable, 'that there are far too many\nrioters. One would have been quite sufficient. If there had been only\none small undersized rioter, I should have quelled him with the utmost\nseverity.'\n\n'Constable,' said the Mayor, sternly, 'in the name of His Majesty the\nKing, I call on you to arrest these rioters without delay.'\n\n'Look here,' said Bill, 'you're labourin' under an error. This ain't a\nriot at all. This is merely two puddin'-thieves gettin' a hidin' for\ntryin' to steal our Puddin'.'\n\n'Puddin'-thieves!' exclaimed the Mayor. 'Don't tell me that\npuddin'-thieves have come to Tooraloo.'\n\n 'It staggers me with pain and grief,\n I can't believe it's true,\n That we should have a puddin'-thief\n Or two in Tooraloo. 'It is enough to make one dumb\n And very pale in hue\n To know that puddin'-thieves should come\n To sacred Tooraloo. 'The Law's just anger must appear. Ho! seize these scoundrels who\n Pollute the moral atmosphere\n Of rural Tooraloo.'\n\n'We protest against these cruel words,' said the Possum. 'We have been\nassaulted and battered and snout-bended by ruffians of the worst\ndescription.'\n\n'How can Your Worship say such things,' said the Wombat, 'and us\na-wearin' bell-toppers before your very eyes.'\n\n'If you've been assaulted and battered,' said the Mayor, 'we shall have\nto arrest the assaulters and batterers, as well.'\n\n'What's fair to one is fair to all,' said the Constable. 'You'll admit\nthat, of course?' he added to Bill. 'I admit nothin' of the sort,' said Bill. 'If you want to arrest\nanybody, do your duty and arrest these here puddin'-snatchers. 'If you're an officer of the Law,\n A constant felon-catcher,\n Then do not hesitate before\n A common puddin'-snatcher.'\n\n[Illustration]\n\n'We call on you to arrest these assaulters and batterers of people\nwearing top-hats,' said the puddin'-thieves;\n\n 'Our innocence let all attest,\n We prove it by our hatter;\n It is your duty to arrest\n Not those in top-hats of the best\n But those who top-hats batter.'\n\n'It's very clear that somebody has to be arrested,' said the Mayor. 'I\ncan't be put to the trouble of wearing my robes of office in public\nwithout somebody having to pay for it. I don't care whether you arrest\nthe top-hat batterers, or the battered top-hatters; all I say is, do\nyour duty, whatever happens--\n\n 'So somebody, no matter who,\n You must arrest or rue it;\n As I'm the Mayor of Tooraloo,\n And you've the painful job to do,\n I call on you to do it.'\n\n[Illustration]\n\n'Very well,' said the Constable, peevishly, 'as I've got to take all the\nresponsibility, I'll settle the matter by arresting the Puddin'. As far\nas I can see, he's the ringleader in this disturbance.'\n\n'You're a carrot-nosed poltroon,' said the Puddin' loudly. 'As for the\nMayor, he's a sausage-shaped porous plaster,' and he gave him a sharp\npinch in the leg. 'What a ferocious Puddin',' said the Mayor, turning as pale as a turnip. 'Officer, do your duty and arrest this dangerous felon before he\nperpetrates further sacrilegious acts.'\n\n'That's all very well, you know,' said the Constable, turning as pale as\ntripe; 'but he might nip me.'\n\n'I can't help that,' cried the Mayor, angrily. 'At all costs I must be\nprotected from danger. Do your duty and arrest this felon with your\nhat.'\n\nThe Constable looked round, gasped, and summoning all his courage,\nscooped up the Puddin' in his hat. 'My word,' he said, breathlessly, 'but that was a narrow squeak. I\nexpected every moment to be my last.'\n\n'Now we breathe more freely,' said the Mayor, and led the way to the\nTooraloo Court House. 'If this isn't too bad,' said Bill, furiously.",

There was nobody in Court\nexcept the Judge and the Usher, who were seated on the bench having a\nquiet game of cards over a bottle of port. 'Order in the Court,' shouted the Usher, as they all came crowding in;\nand the Judge, seeing the Constable carrying the Puddin' in his hat,\nsaid severely:\n\n'This won't do, you know; it's Contempt of Court, bringing your lunch\nhere.'\n\n'An' it please you, My Lord,' said the Constable hurriedly, 'this here\nPuddin' has been arrested for pinching the Mayor.'\n\n'As a consequence of which, I see you've pinched the Puddin',' said the\nJudge facetiously. 'Dear me, what spirits I am in to-day, to be sure!'\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n'The felon has an aroma most dangerously suggestive of beef gravy,' said\nthe Usher, solemnly. 'Beef gravy?' said the Judge. 'Now, it seems to me that the aroma is\nmuch more subtly suggestive of steak and kidney.'\n\n'Garnished, I think, with onions,' said the Usher. 'In order to settle this knotty point, just hand the felon up here a\nmoment,' said the Judge. 'I don't suppose you've got a knife about you?'\nhe asked. 'I've got a paper-knife,' said the Usher; and, the Puddin' having been\nhanded up to the bench, the Judge and the Usher cut a slice each, and\nhad another glass of port. Bill was naturally enraged at seeing total strangers eating\nPuddin'-owners' private property, and he called out loudly:\n\n'Common justice and the lawful rights of Puddin'-owners.'\n\n'Silence in the Court while the Judge is eating,' shouted the Usher; and\nthe Judge said severely--\n\n 'I really think you ought\n To see I'm taking food,\n So, Silence in the Court! (I'm also taking port),\n If you intrude, in manner rude,\n A lesson you'll be taught.'\n\n'An' it please Your Lordship,' said the Mayor, pointing to Bill, 'this\nperson is a brutal assaulter of people wearing top-hats.'\n\n'No insults,' said Bill, and he gave the Mayor a slap in the face. [Illustration]\n\nThe Mayor went as pale as cheese, and the Usher called out: 'No\nface-slapping while the judge is dining!' and the Judge said, angrily--\n\n 'It's really far from nice,\n As you ought to be aware,\n While I am chewing a slice,\n To have you slapping the Mayor. If I have to complain of you again\n I'll commit you in a trice,\n You'd better take my advice;\n Don't let me warn you twice.'\n\n'All very well for you to talk,' said Bill, scornfully, 'sittin' up\nthere eatin' our Puddin'. I'm a respectable Puddin'-owner, an' I calls\non you to hand over that Puddin' under threat of an action-at-law for\nwrongful imprisonment, trespass, and illegally using the same.'\n\n'Personal remarks to the Judge are not allowed,' shouted the Usher, and\nthe Judge said solemnly--\n\n 'A Judge must be respected,\n A Judge you mustn't knock,\n Or else you'll be detected\n And shoved into the dock. You'll get a nasty shock\n When gaolers turn the lock. In prison cell you'll give a yell\n To hear the hangman knock.'\n\nHere, the Usher took off his coat, as the day was warm, and hung it on\nthe back of his chair. He then rapped on the bench and said--\n\n 'In the name of the Law I must request\n Less noise while we're having a well-earned rest,\n For the Judge and the Usher never must shirk\n\n[Illustration]\n\n A well-earned rest in the middle of work. It's the duty of both they are well aware\n To preserve their precious lives with care;\n It's their duty, when feeling overwrought,\n To preserve their lives with Puddin' and Port.'\n\nHe sat down and tossed off a bumper of port to prove his words. 'Your\ndeal, I think,' said the Judge, and they went on sipping and munching\nand dealing out cards. At this, Bill gave way to despair. 'What on earth's to be done?' he asked. 'Here's these legal ferrets has\ngot our Puddin' in their clutches, and here's us, spellbound with\nanguish, watchin' them wolfin' it. Here's a situation as would wring\ngroans from the breast of a boiled onion.'\n\n'Why, it's worse than droppin' soverins down a drain,' said Sam. 'It's worse than catchin' your whiskers in the mangle,' said Bill. By a fortunate chance, at this moment the Possum happened to put his\nsnout within Bill's reach, and Bill hit it a swinging clout to relieve\nhis feelings. 'It's unlawful,' shouted the Possum, 'to hit a man's snout unexpectedly\nwhen he isn't engaged puddin'-stealing.'\n\n'Observe the rules,' said the Wombat solemnly.",

'Be kind to snouts when\nnot engaged in theft.'\n\n'If it hadn't been for you two tryin' to steal our Puddin' all this\ntrouble wouldn't have happened,' said Bill. 'It's the Mayor's fault for bringing us all here,' cried the Possum,\nangrily. 'If you was a just man, you'd clout him on the snout, too.'\n\n'The Mayor's to blame,' said the Wombat. 'What about the whole lot of us\nsettin' on to him?'\n\nAt this suggestion the Mayor trembled so violently that his hat fell\noff. 'What dreadful words are these?' he asked, and the Constable said\nhurriedly, 'Never set on to the Mayor while the local Constable is\npresent. Let that be your golden rule.'\n\n'That's all very well,' said Bill, 'but if you two hadn't come\ninterferin' at the wrong moment, our Puddin' wouldn't have been\narrested, and all this trouble wouldn't have happened. As you're\nresponsible, the question now is, What are you going to do about it?'\n\n'My advice is,' said the Constable, impressively, 'resign yourselves to\nFate.'\n\n'My advice,' said the Mayor in a low voice, 'is general expressions of\nesteem and friendship, hand-shaking all round, inquiries after each\nother's health, chatty remarks about the weather, the price of potatoes,\nand how well the onions are looking.'\n\nBill treated these suggestions with scorn. 'If any man in the company\nhas better advice to offer, let him stand forth,' said he. Bunyip Bluegum stood forth. 'My advice,' he said, 'is this: try the case\nwithout the Judge; or, in other words, assume the legal functions of\nthis defaulting personage in the bag-wig who is at present engaged in\ndistending himself illegally with our Puddin'. For mark how runs the\naxiom--\n\n 'If you've a case without a Judge,\n It's clear your case will never budge;\n But if a Judge you have to face,\n The chances are you'll lose your case. To win your case, and save your pelf,\n Why, try the blooming case yourself!'\n\n'As usual, our friend here solves the problem in a few well-chosen\nwords,' said Bill, and preparations were made at once for trying the\ncase. After a sharp struggle, in which it was found necessary to bend\nthe Possum's snout severely in order to make him listen to reason, the\npuddin'-thieves were forced into the dock. Their top-hats and\nfrock-coats were taken away, for fear the jury might take them for\nundertakers, and not scoundrels. The Mayor and the Constable were pushed\ninto the jury box to perform the duties of twelve good men and true, and\nthe others took seats about the Court as witnesses for the prosecution. There was some delay before the proceedings began, for Bill said,\n'Here's me, the Crown Prosecutor, without a wig. This'll never do.'\nFortunately, a wig was found in the Judge's private room, and Bill put\nit on with great satisfaction. 'I'm afraid this is unconstitutional,' said the Mayor to the Constable. [Illustration]\n\n'It is unconstitutional,' said the Constable; 'but it's better than\ngetting a punch on the snout.'\n\nThe Mayor turned so pale at this that the Constable had to thrust a\nbanana into his mouth to restore his courage. 'Thank you,' said the Mayor, peevishly; 'but, on the whole, I prefer to\nbe restored with peeled bananas.'\n\n'Order in the jury box,' said Bill, sharply, and the Mayor having\nhurriedly bolted his banana, peel and all, proceedings commenced. [Illustration]\n\n'Gentlemen of the Jury,' said Bill, 'the case before you is one\naboundin' in horror and amazement. Persons of the lowest morals has\ndisguised themselves in pot-hats in order to decoy a Puddin' of tender\nyears from his lawful guardians. It is related in the archives of the\nNoble Order of Puddin'-owners that previous to this dastardly attempt a\nvaluable bag, the property of Sir Benjimen Brandysnap, had been stolen\nand the said Puddin'-owners invited to look at a present inside it.

'I now propose to call Sir Benjimen Brandysnap as first witness for the\nprosecution,' said Bill. 'Kindly step into the witness-box, Sir\nBenjimen, and relate the circumstances ensuin' on your bag bein' stole.'\n\nBenjimen stepped into the box, and, taking a piece of paper from his egg\nbasket, said solemnly: 'I was very busy that morning, Gentlemen of the\nJury, owing to the activity of the vegetables, as hereunder described--\n\n 'On Tuesday morn, as it happened by chance,\n The parsnips stormed in a rage,\n Because the young carrots were singing like parrots\n On top of the onions' cage. 'The radishes swarmed on the angry air\n Around with the bumble bees,\n While the brussels-sprouts were pulling the snouts\n Of all the young French peas. 'The artichokes bounded up and down\n On top of the pumpkins' heads,\n And the cabbage was dancing the highland fling\n All over the onion beds. 'So I hadn't much time, as Your Honour perceives,\n For watching the habits of puddin'-thieves.'\n\n'Tut, tut, Sir Benjimen,' said Bill, 'stir up your memory, sir; cast\nyour eye over them felons in the dock, and tell the Court how you seen\nthem steal the bag.'\n\n'The fact is,' said Benjimen, after studying the puddin'-thieves\ncarefully, 'as they had their backs turned to me when they were engaged\nin stealing the bag, I should be able to judge better if they were\nturned round.'\n\n'Officer,' said Bill to Bunyip Bluegum, 'kindly turn the felons' backs\nto the witness.'\n\nThe Possum and the Wombat objected, saying there wasn't room enough in\nthe witness-box to turn round, so it was found necessary to twist their\nsnouts the opposite way. 'From this aspect,' said Ben, 'I have no hesitation in saying that those\nare the backs that stole the bags.'\n\n'Make a note of that, Gentlemen of the Jury,' said Bill, and the\nConstable obligingly made a note of it on his banana bag. 'The identity of the bag-stealers bein' now settled,' went on Bill, 'I\nshall kindly ask Sir Benjimen to step down, and call on Sir Samuel\nSawnoff to ascend the witness-box.'\n\nSam stepped up cheerfully, but, as the witness-box was the wrong size\nfor Penguins, they had to hand him a chair to stand on. [Illustration]\n\n'Now, Sir Samuel,' said Bill, impressively, 'I am about to ask you a\nmost important leadin' question. Do you happen to notice such a thing\nas a Puddin' in the precinks of the Court?'\n\n[Illustration]\n\nSam shaded his eyes with his flapper and, seeing the Puddin' on the\nbench, started back dramatically. 'Do my eyes deceive me, or is yon object a Puddin'?' he cried. 'Well acted,' said the Mayor, and the Constable clapped loudly. 'I am now about to ask you another leadin' question,' said Bill. 'Do you\nrecognize that Puddin'?'\n\n'Do I recognize that Puddin'?' cried Sam in thrilling tones. 'That\nPuddin', sir, is dearer to me than an Uncle. That Puddin', sir, an' me\nhas registered vows of eternal friendship and esteem. [Illustration]\n\n 'That Puddin', sir, an' me have sailed the seas,\n Known tropic suns, and braved the Arctic breeze,\n We've heard on Popocatepetl's peak\n The savage Tom-Tom sharpenin' of his beak,\n We've served the dreadful Jim-Jam up on toast,\n When shipwrecked off the Coromandel coast,\n And when we heard the frightful Bim-Bam rave,\n Have plunged beneath the Salonican wave. We've delved for Bulbuls' eggs on coral strands,\n And chased the Pompeydon in distant lands. That Puddin', sir, and me, has, back to back,\n Withstood the fearful Rumty Tums' attack,\n And swum the Indian Ocean for our lives,\n Pursued by Oysters, armed with oyster knives. Let me but say, e'er these adventures cloy,\n I've knowed that Puddin' since he were a boy.'\n\n[Illustration]\n\n'All lies,' sang out the Puddin', looking over the rim of his basin. 'For well you know that you and old Bill Barnacle collared me off Curry\nand Rice after rolling him off the iceberg.'\n\n'Albert, Albert,' said Bill, sternly. 'Where's your manners:\ninterruptin' Sir Samuel in that rude way, and him a-performin' like an\nactor for your deliverance!'\n\n'How much longer do you expect me to stay up here, bein' guzzled by\nthese legal land-crabs?' demanded the Puddin'. 'You shall stay there, Albert, till the case is well and truly tried by\nthese here noble Peers of the Realm assembled,' said Bill, impressively. 'Too much style about you,' said the Puddin', rudely, and he threw the\nJudge's glass of port into Bill's face, remarking: 'Take that, for being\na pumpkin-headed old shellback.'\n\nThere was a great uproar over this very illegal act. The Judge was\nenraged at losing his port, and the Mayor was filled with horror because\nBill wiped his face on the mayoral hat.",

The Judge was\nenraged at losing his port, and the Mayor was filled with horror because\nBill wiped his face on the mayoral hat. Sam had to feign amazement at\nbeing called a liar, and the puddin'-thieves kept shouting: 'Time, time;\nwe can't stand here all day.'\n\n[Illustration]\n\nIn desperation, Bill bawled at the top of his voice: 'I call on\nDetective Bluegum to restore order in the Court.'\n\nBunyip ran into the witness-box and, with a ready wit, shouted: 'I have\ndreadful news to impart to this honourable Court.'\n\nAll eyes, of course, turned on Bunyip, who, raising his hand with an\nimpressive gesture, said in thrilling tones: 'From information\nreceived, it has been discovered that the Puddin' was poisoned at\nten-thirty this morning.'\n\nThis news restored order at once. The Judge turned pale as lard, and the\nUsher, having a darker complexion, turned as pale as soap. The Puddin'\ncouldn't turn pale, so he let out a howl of terror. 'Poisoned,' said the Usher, feebly. 'How, how?'\n\n'Poisoned,' said the Judge, feeling his stomach with trembling hands. 'Until this moment I was under the delusion that a somewhat unpleasant\nsensation of being, as it were, distended, was merely due to having\neaten seven slices. But if--'\n\n[Illustration]\n\n'If,' said the Usher, in a quavering voice--\n\n 'If you take a poisoned Puddin'\n And that poisoned Puddin' chew\n The sensations that you suffer\n I should rather say were due\n To the poison in the Puddin'\n In the act of Poisoning You. And I think the fact suffices\n Through this dreadfulest of crimes,\n As you've eaten seven slices\n You've been poisoned seven times.'\n\n'It was your idea having it up on the bench,' said the Judge, angrily,\nto the Usher. 'Now,\n\n 'If what you say is true,\n That idea you'll sadly rue,\n The poison I have eaten is entirely due to you. It's by taking your advice\n That I've had my seventh slice,\n So I'll tell you what I'll do\n Why, I'll beat you black and blue,'\n\nand with that he hit the Usher a smart crack on the head with a port\nbottle. 'Don't strike a poisoned man,' shouted the Usher; but the Judge went on\nsmacking and cracking him with the bottle, singing--\n\n 'The emotion of pity\n Need never be sought\n In a Judge who's been poisoned\n By Puddin' and Port.'\n\nIn desperation, the Usher leapt off the bench, and landed head first in\nthe dock, where he stuck like a sardine. [Illustration]\n\n'Too bad, too bad,' shouted the puddin'-thieves. 'Crowding in here where\nthere's only room for two.' Before they could get rid of the Usher, the\nJudge bounded over the bench and commenced whacking them with the\nbottle, singing--\n\n 'As I find great satisfaction\n Hitting anybody who\n Can offer that distraction,\n Why, I'll have a go at you,'\nand he went on bounding and whacking away with the bottle, while the\npuddin'-thieves kept roaring, and the Usher kept screaming. The uproar\nwas deafening. 'Just listen to it,' said Bill, in despair. 'I'd like to know how on\nearth we are going to finish the case with all this umptydoodle rumpus\ngoing on.'\n\n'Why,' said Bunyip, 'the simpler course is not to finish the case at\nall.'\n\n'Solved, as usual,' said Bill and, seizing the Puddin' from the bench,\nhe dashed out of Court, followed by Sam, Ben, and Bunyip Bluegum. As they ran they could hear the Judge still whacking away at everybody,\nincluding the Mayor, and the Constable, whose screams were piercing. 'Indeed,' said Bunyip--\n\n 'I rather think they'll rather rue\n The haste with which they sought to sue\n Us, in the Court of Tooraloo. For, mark how just is Fate! 'The whole benighted, blooming crew,\n The Puddin'-thieves, the Usher too,\n Are being beaten black and blue\n With bottles on the pate. 'I rather think they will eschew,\n In future, Puddin'-owners who\n Pass through the simple rural view\n About the town of Tooraloo.'\n\n'And now,' said Bill, when they had run a mile or two beyond the town,\n'and now for some brilliant plan, swiftly conceived, which will put a\nstop to this Puddin'-snatchin' business for ever. For the point is,'\ncontinued Bill, lowering his voice, 'here we are pretty close up to the\nend of the book, and something will have to be done in a Tremendous\nHurry, or else we'll be cut off short by the cover.'\n\n'The solution is perfectly simple,' said Bunyip. 'We have merely to stop\nwandering along the road, and the story will stop wandering through the\nbook. This, too, will baffle the puddin'-thieves, for while we wander\nalong the road, our Puddin' is exposed to the covetous glances of every\npassing puddin'-snatcher. Let us, then, remove to some safe, secluded\nspot and settle down to a life of gaiety, dance, and song, where no\npuddin'-thief will dare to show a sacrilegious head. Let us, in fact,\nbuild a house in a tree.",

Let us, in fact,\nbuild a house in a tree. For, mark the advantages of such a habitation--\n\n 'Up on high\n No neighbours pry\n In at the window,\n On the sly. 'Up in a tree\n You're always free\n From bores and bailiffs,\n You'll agree. 'Up on high\n Bricks you shy\n At bores and bailiffs\n Passing by. 'Up in the leaves\n One never grieves\n Over the pranks\n Of puddin'-thieves. 'If you would be\n Gay and free,\n Take my tip and\n Live in a tree.'\n\n'We will, we will,' shouted the Puddin'-owners; but the Puddin' said\nsourly: 'This is all very well, all this high falutin'. But what about\nthe dreadful news of being poisoned at ten-thirty this morning?'\n\n'You ain't poisoned, Albert,' said Bill. 'That was only a mere _ruse de\nguerre_, as they say in the noosepapers.'\n\n'A what?' demanded the Puddin', suspiciously. 'Let words be sufficient, without explanation,' said Bill, severely. 'And as we haven't time to waste talkin' philosophy to a Puddin', why,\ninto the bag he goes, or we'll never get the story finished.'\n\nSo Puddin' was bundled into the bag, and Bill said, hurriedly:\n'Brilliant as our friend Bunyip had proved himself with his ready wit,\nit remains for old Bill to suggest the brightest idea of all. Here is\nour friend Ben, a market gardener of the finest description. Very well. Why not build our house in his market garden. The advantages are\nobvious. Vegetables free of charge the whole year round, and fruit in\nseason. Eggs to be had for the askin', and a fine, simple, honest feller\nlike Ben, to chat to of an evening. What could be more delightful?'\n\nBen looked very grave at this proposal and began: 'I very much doubt\nwhether there will be enough bed clothes for four people, let alone the\ncarrots are very nervous of strangers--' when Bill cut him short with a\nhearty clap on the back. 'Say no more,' said Bill, handsomely. 'Rough, good-humoured fellers like\nus don't need apologies, or any social fal-lals at all. We'll take you\nas we find you. Without more ado, we shall build a house in your market\ngarden.'\n\nAnd, without more ado, they did. The picture overleaf saves the trouble of explaining how they built it,\nand what a splendid house it is. In order that the Puddin' might have\nplenty of exercise, they made him a little Puddin' paddock, whence he\ncan shout rude remarks to the people passing by; a habit, I grieve to\nstate, he is very prone to. [Illustration]\n\nOf course, at night they pull up the ladder in case a stray\npuddin'-thief happens to be prowling around. If a friend calls to have a\nquiet chat, or to join in a sing-song round the fire, they let the\nladder down for him. And a very pleasant life they lead, sitting of a summer evening on the\nbalcony while Ben does his little market-garden jobs below, and the\nPuddin' throws bits of bark at the cabbages, and pulls faces at the\nlittle pickle onions, in order to make them squeak with terror. On winter nights there is always Puddin' and hot coffee for supper, and\nmany's the good go in I've had up there, a-sitting round the fire. I didn't mean to let on that I knew their address, on account of so many\npeople wanting to have a go at the Puddin'. However, it's out now. When the wind blows and the rain comes down, it's jolly sitting up aloft\nin the snug tree-house, especially when old Bill is in good form and\ngives us the _Salt Junk Sarah_, with all hands joining in the chorus. 'Oh, rolling round the ocean,\n From a far and foreign land,\n May suit the common notion\n That a sailor's life is grand. 'But as for me, I'd sooner be\n A-roaring here at home\n About the rolling, roaring life\n Of them that sails the foam. 'For the homeward-bounder's chorus,\n Which he roars across the foam,\n Is all about chucking a sailor's life,\n And settling down at home. 'Home, home, home,\n That's the song of them that roam,\n The song of the roaring, rolling sea\n Is all about rolling home.'",
