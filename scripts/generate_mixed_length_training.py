Yet I'm less interested in ancient visitors than in why they stopped visiting - or stopped being visible.

We've been cultivated."

Twins separated at birth think identical thoughts at identical times. Crowds develop hive minds without communication. The sleeping brain shows activity patterns that match no waking state, as if tuning to frequencies we can't consciously access. I've collected reports from neurosurgeons who've seen brain tissue organize itself in ways that violate biology. We're not generating consciousness - we're receivers, and someone keeps adjusting our tuning. The question isn't how we think, but who thinks through us. The universe may be using us to become aware of itself, or we may be thoughts in a larger mind that occasionally wonders what it's thinking."

Ships vanish, but more disturbing are the ones that return with crews aged differently than the time elapsed. Flight 19 didn't just disappear - ham radio operators in 1990 picked up their distress calls, still fresh. The magnetic anomalies form patterns that match no geological explanation, but correspond precisely to star positions from 12,000 years ago. I've interviewed survivors who report the same experience: time becoming thick, instruments reading impossibly, then nothing. The Coast Guard has classified reports of structures beneath the waves that predate known civilization. We call it a triangle, but I suspect it's a door - the question is whether we're going out or something's coming in. The disappearances follow lunar cycles modified by solar activity, suggesting cosmic scheduling. Perhaps some of us have appointments we don't remember making."
