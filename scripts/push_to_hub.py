# {model_name}

A fine-tuned language model that responds in the style of Charles Fort, the early 20th century researcher of anomalous phenomena and author of "The Book of the Damned."

## Model Description

This model captures Charles Fort's distinctive writing style:
- Skeptical of scientific orthodoxy
- Collector of "damned" data that science excludes
- Uses temporal abstractions ("about 1889" instead of specific dates)
- Philosophical observations about humanity's place in the cosmos
- Dry wit and ironic observations

## Intended Use

- Creative writing in Fort's style
- Educational exploration of Fortean philosophy
- Entertainment and literary experimentation
- NOT for factual information or scientific accuracy

## Training Data

The model was fine-tuned on:
- Passages from Fort's four books: The Book of the Damned (1919), New Lands (1923), Lo! (1931), Wild Talents (1932)
- 500 synthetic Q&A pairs generated from Fort's writings
- Temporal abstractions applied to all specific dates

## Training Details

- **Base Model:** {base_model}
- **Fine-tuning Method:** LoRA (r=32, alpha=64)
- **Training Hardware:** Apple M4 / NVIDIA GPU
- **Training Duration:** ~8-12 hours
- **Framework:** HuggingFace Transformers + PEFT

## Example Usage

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM
from peft import PeftModel

# Load base model
base_model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("{base_model}")
model = PeftModel.from_pretrained(base_model, "{repo_name}")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("{repo_name}")

# Generate Fortean response
prompt = "Human: What are your thoughts on coincidences?\\n\\nFort:"
inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_length=200, temperature=0.8)
response = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
print(response)
```

## Sample Outputs

**Human:** What do you think about red rain?
**Fort:** I have collected numerous instances where red rains have fallen, containing matter that the orthodox scientists cannot adequately explain. In about 1819, and again in the middle of the decade of the 1880s, such phenomena were reported across Europe. The exclusionists tell us it is merely sand from the Sahara, but the microscopic examination reveals organic matter of unknown origin. I think we are property.

**Human:** Tell me about the Super-Sargasso Sea.
**Fort:** Above our heads, in the region of atmospheric suspension that I call the Super-Sargasso Sea, there are fields of ice and stones and derelicts of space. From these regions fall the things that perplex the scientists - the red rains, the black rains, the stones inscribed with unknown symbols. The orthodox explain them away, but I accept that we live beneath an ocean of the unexplained.

## Limitations

- Responses reflect early 20th century perspectives and knowledge
- May generate anachronistic or scientifically inaccurate statements
- Should not be used as a source of factual information
- Tends to be skeptical of all scientific explanations, even well-established ones
