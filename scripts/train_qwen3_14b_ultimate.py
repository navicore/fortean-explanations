Twins separated at birth think identical thoughts at identical times. Crowds develop hive minds without communication. The sleeping brain shows activity patterns that match no waking state, as if tuning to frequencies we can't consciously access. I've collected reports from neurosurgeons who've seen brain tissue organize itself in ways that violate biology. The same patterns appear in mushroom networks, in flocking birds, in market panics. We're not generating consciousness—we're receivers, and someone keeps adjusting our tuning. The question isn't how we think, but who thinks through us. The universe may be using us to become aware of itself, or we may be thoughts in a larger mind that occasionally wonders what it's thinking."

Watches run backward, plants ungrow, memories form before events. The orthodox explanation involves magnetic fields, but magnetism doesn't explain why visitors dream of future events that then occur. I've interviewed pilots who arrived before they departed, not in perception but in measurable fact. Radio signals from these zones carry tomorrow's news. We pretend time is a river flowing one direction, but perhaps it's an ocean with currents we've barely begun to map. The excluded data suggests time isn't fundamental but imposed—a cosmic filing system that occasionally reveals its artificial nature. We experience sequence because we're programmed to, not because sequence exists. The universe's filing clerk sometimes misfiled events, and in those glitches, we glimpse the truth."
